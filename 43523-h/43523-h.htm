<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>The fortune of Henry Thoreau as an author of books
has been peculiar, and such as to indicate more permanence
of his name and fame than could be predicted
of many of his contemporaries. In the years of his literary
activity (twenty-five in all), from 1837 to 1862,&mdash;when
he died, not quite forty-five years old,&mdash;he published
but two volumes, and those with much delay and
difficulty in finding a publisher. But in the thirty-two
years after his death, nine volumes were published from
his manuscripts and fugitive pieces,&mdash;the present being
the tenth. Besides these, two biographies of Thoreau
had appeared in America, and two others in England,
with numerous reviews and sketches of the man and
his writings,&mdash;enough to make several volumes more.
Since 1894 other biographies and other volumes have
appeared, and now his writings in twenty volumes are
coming from the press. The sale of his books and the
interest in his life are greater than ever; and he seems
to have grown early into an American classic, like his
Concord neighbors, Emerson and Hawthorne. Pilgrimages
are made to his grave and his daily haunts, as to
theirs,&mdash;and those who come find it to be true, as was
said by an accomplished woman (Miss Elizabeth Hoar)
soon after his death, that "Concord is Henry's monument,
adorned with suitable inscriptions by his own
hand."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_X" id="Page_X">x</a></span></p>

<p>When Horace wrote of a noble Roman family,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Crescit occulto velut arbor aevo</p>
<p>Fama Marcelli,"&mdash;</p></div></div>

<p>he pointed in felicitous phrase to the only fame that
posterity has much regarded,&mdash;the slow-growing, deep-rooted
laurel of renown. And Shakespeare, citing the
old English rhyming saw,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Small herbs have grace,</p>
<p>Great weeds do grow apace,"&mdash;</p>
</div></div>

<p>signified the same thing in a parable,&mdash;the popularity
and suddenness of transient things, contrasted with the
usefully permanent. There were plenty of authors in
Thoreau's time (of whom Willis may be taken as the
type) who would have smiled loftily to think that a
rustic from the Shawsheen and Assabet could compete
with the traveled scholar or elegant versifier who commanded
the homage of drawing-rooms and magazines,
for the prize of lasting remembrance; yet who now are
forgotten, or live a shadowy life in the alcoves of libraries,
piping forth an ineffective voice, like the shades
in Virgil's Tartarus. But Thoreau was wiser when he
wrote at the end of his poem, "Inspiration,"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Fame cannot tempt the bard</p>
<p>Who's famous with his God;</p>
<p>Nor laurel him reward</p>
<p>Who has his Maker's nod."</p>
</div></div>

<p>He strove but little for glory, either immediate or
posthumous, well knowing that it is the inevitable and
unpursued result of what men do or say,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>"Our fatal shadow that walks by us still."</p></div></div>

<p>The Letters of Thoreau, though not less remarkable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XI" id="Page_XI">xi</a></span>
in some aspects than what he wrote carefully for publication,
have thus far scarcely had justice done them.
The selection made for a small volume in 1865 was
designedly done to exhibit one phase of his character,&mdash;the
most striking, if you will, but not the most native
or attractive. "In his own home," says Ellery Channing,
who knew him more inwardly than any other,
"he was one of those characters who may be called
'household treasures;' always on the spot, with skillful
eye and hand, to raise the best melons in the garden,
plant the orchard with choicest trees, or act as extempore
mechanic; fond of the pets, his sister's flowers, or
sacred Tabby; kittens were his favorites,&mdash;he would
play with them by the half-hour. No whim or coldness,
no absorption of his time by public or private business,
deprived those to whom he belonged of his kindness
and affection. He did the duties that lay nearest, and
satisfied those in his immediate circle; and whatever
the impressions from the theoretical part of his writings,
when the matter is probed to the bottom, good
sense and good feeling will be detected in it." This is
preëminently true; and the affectionate conviction of
this made his sister Sophia dissatisfied with Emerson's
rule of selection among the letters. This she confided
to me, and this determined me, should occasion offer,
to give the world some day a fuller and more familiar
view of our friend.</p>

<p>For this purpose I have chosen many letters and
mere notes, illustrating his domestic and gossipy moods,&mdash;for
that element was in his mixed nature, inherited
from the lively maternal side,&mdash;and even the colloquial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XII" id="Page_XII">xii</a></span>
vulgarity (using the word in the strict sense of "popular
speech") that he sometimes allowed himself. In
his last years he revolted a little at this turn of his
thoughts, and, as Channing relates, "rubbed out the
more humorous parts of his essays, originally a relief
to their sterner features, saying, 'I cannot bear the
levity I find;'" to which Channing replied that he ought
to spare it, even to the puns, in which he abounded almost
as much as Shakespeare. His friend was right,&mdash;the
obvious incongruity was as natural to Thoreau
as the grace and French elegance of his best sentences.
In the dozen letters newly added to this edition, these
contrasted qualities hardly appear so striking as in the
longer, earlier ones; but they all illustrate events of his
life or points in his character which are essential for
fully understanding this most original of all American
authors. The present volume is enlarged by some thirty
pages, chiefly by additional letters to Ricketson, and
all those to C. H. Greene. The modesty and self-deprecation
in the Michigan correspondence will attract
notice.</p>

<p>I have not rejected the common and trivial in
these letters; being well assured that what the increasing
number of Thoreau's readers desire is to see this
piquant original just as he was,&mdash;not arrayed in the
paradoxical cloak of the Stoic sage, nor sitting complacent
in the cynic earthenware cave of Diogenes, and
bidding Alexander stand out of his sunshine. He did
those acts also; but they were not the whole man. He
was far more poet than cynic or stoic; he had the
proud humility of those sects, but still more largely that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XIII" id="Page_XIII">xiii</a></span>
unconscious pride which comes to the poet when he
sees that his pursuits are those of the few and not of
the multitude. This perception came early to Thoreau,
and was expressed in some unpublished verses dating
from his long, solitary rambles, by night and day, on
the seashore at Staten Island, where he first learned the
sombre magnificence of Ocean. He feigns himself the
son of what might well be one of Homer's fishermen,
or the shipwrecked seaman of Lucretius,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">"Saevis projectus ab undis<br />
Cui tantum in vita restet transire malorum,"&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>and then goes on thus with his parable:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"Within a humble cot that looks to sea,</p>
<p class="i1">Daily I breathe this curious warm life;</p>
<p>Beneath a friendly haven's sheltering lee</p>
<p class="i1">My noiseless day with mystery still is rife.</p></div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"'T is here, they say, my simple life began,&mdash;</p>
<p class="i1">And easy credence to the tale I lend,</p>
<p>For well I know 't is here I am a man,&mdash;</p>
<p class="i1">But who will simply tell me of the end?</p></div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"These eyes, fresh-opened, spied the far-off Sea,</p>
<p class="i1">That like a silent godfather did stand,</p>
<p>Nor uttered one explaining word to me,</p>
<p class="i1">While introducing straight godmother Land.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza"><p class="o1">"And yonder still stretches that silent Main,</p>
<p class="i1">With many glancing ships besprinkled o'er;</p>
<p>And earnest still I gaze and gaze again</p>
<p class="i1">Upon the selfsame waves and friendly shore.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"Infinite work my hands find there to do,</p>
<p class="i1">Gathering the relics which the waves upcast:</p>
<p>Each storm doth scour the sea for something new,</p>
<p class="i1">And every time the strangest is the last.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XIV" id="Page_XIV">xiv</a></span></p></div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"My neighbors sometimes come with lumbering carts.</p>
<p class="i1">As if they wished my pleasant toil to share;</p>
<p>But straight they go again to distant marts,</p>
<p class="i1">For only weeds and ballast are their care."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>"Only weeds and ballast?" that is exactly what
Thoreau's neighbors would have said he was gathering,
for the most of his days; yet now he is seen to have
collected something more durable and precious than
they with their implements and market-carts. If they
viewed him with a kind of scorn and pity, it must be
said that he returned the affront; only time seems to
have sided with the poet in the controversy that he
maintained against his busy age.</p>

<p>Superiority,&mdash;moral elevation, without peevishness
or condescension,&mdash;this was Thoreau's distinguishing
quality. He softened it with humor, and sometimes
sharpened it with indignation; but he directed his satire
and his censure as often against himself as against mankind;
men he truly loved,&mdash;if they would not obstruct
his humble and strictly chosen path. The letters here
printed show this, if I mistake not,&mdash;and the many
other epistles of his, still uncollected, would hardly vary
the picture he has sketched of himself, though they
would add new facts. Those most to be sought for are
his replies to the generous letters of his one English
correspondent.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
</p>

<p>The profile portrait reproduced in photogravure for
this volume is less known than it should be,&mdash;for it
alone of the four likenesses extant shows the aquiline
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XV" id="Page_XV">xv</a></span>
features as his comrades of the wood and mountain saw
them,&mdash;not weakened by any effort to bring him to
the standard of other men in garb or expression. The
artist, Mr. Walton Ricketson, knew and admired him.
To him and to his sister Anna I am indebted for the
letters and other material found in their volume
"Daniel Ricketson and His Friends."</p>

<h2>I<br />

YEARS OF DISCIPLINE</h2>

<p>It was a happy thought of Thoreau's friend Ellery
Channing, himself a poet, to style our Concord hermit
the "poet-naturalist;" for there seemed to be no year
of his life and no hour of his day when Nature did
not whisper some secret in his ear,&mdash;so intimate was
he with her from childhood. In another connection,
speaking of natural beauty, Channing said, "There is
Thoreau,&mdash;he knows about it; give him sunshine and
a handful of nuts, and he has enough." He was also a
naturalist in the more customary sense,&mdash;one who
studied and arranged methodically in his mind the facts
of outward nature; a good botanist and ornithologist,
a wise student of insects and fishes; an observer of the
winds, the clouds, the seasons, and all that goes to make
up what we call "weather" and "climate." Yet he was
in heart a poet, and held all the accumulated knowledge
of more than forty years not so much for use as
for delight. As Gray's poor friend West said of himself,
"like a clear-flowing stream, he reflected the
beauteous prospect around;" and Mother Nature had
given Thoreau for his prospect the meandering Indian
river of Concord, the woodland pastures and fair lakes
by which he dwelt or rambled most of his life. Born
in the East Quarter of Concord, July 12, 1817, he died
in the village, May 6, 1862; he was there fitted for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
Harvard College, which he entered in 1833, graduating
in 1837; and for the rest of his life was hardly away
from the town for more than a year in all. Consequently
his letters to his family are few, for he was
usually among them; but when separated from his
elder brother John, or his sisters Helen and Sophia, he
wrote to them, and these are the earliest of his letters
which have been preserved. Always thoughtful for
others, he has left a few facts to aid his biographer,
respecting his birth and early years. In his Journal of
December 27, 1855, he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Recalled this evening, with the aid of Mother, the
various houses (and towns) in which I have lived, and
some events of my life. Born ... in the Minott house
on the Virginia Road, where Father occupied Grandmother's
'thirds,' carrying on the farm. The Catherines
[had] the other half of the house,&mdash;Bob Catherine and
[brother] John threw up the turkeys. Lived there about
eight months; Si Merriam the next neighbor. Uncle
David [Dunbar] died when I was six weeks old.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
 I was
baptized in the old meeting-house, by Dr. Ripley, when
I was three months, and did not cry. [In] the Red
House, where Grandmother lived, we [had] the west side
till October, 1818,&mdash;hiring of Josiah Davis, agent for
the Woodwards; there were Cousin Charles and Uncle
Charles [Dunbar], more or less. According to the day-book
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
first used by Grandfather [Thoreau],<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
 dated
1797 (his part cut out and [then] used by Father in
Concord in 1808-9, and in Chelmsford in 1818-21),
Father hired of Proctor [in Chelmsford], and shop of
Spaulding. Chelmsford till March, 1821; last charge in
Chelmsford about middle of March, 1821. Aunt Sarah
taught me to walk there, when fourteen months old.
Lived next the meeting-house, where they kept the
powder in the garret. Father kept shop and painted
signs, etc.</p>

<p>"Pope's house, at South End in Boston (a ten-footer)
five or six months,&mdash;moved from Chelmsford through
Concord, and may have tarried in Concord a little while.</p>

<p>"Day-book says, 'Moved to Pinkney Street [Boston],
September 10, 1821, on Monday;' Whitwell's house,
Pinckney Street, to March, 1823; brick house, Concord,
to spring of 1826; Davis house (next to Samuel Hoar's)
to May 7, 1827; Shattuck house (now Wm. Munroe's)
to spring of 1835; Hollis Hall, Cambridge, 1833; Aunts'
house to spring of 1837. [This was what is now the
inn called 'Thoreau House.'] At Brownson's [Canton]
while teaching in winter of 1835. Went to New York
with Father peddling in 1836."</p>

<p>This brings the date down to the year in which Henry
Thoreau left college, and when the family letters begin.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
The notes continue, and now begin to have a literary
value.</p>

Yellow House (reformed) till the present."</p>

<p>As may be inferred from this simple record of the
many mansions, chiefly small ones, in which he had
spent his first thirty-eight years, there was nothing distinguished
in the fortunes of Thoreau's family, who
were small merchants, artisans, or farmers mostly. On
the father's side they were from the isle of Jersey,
where a French strain mingled with his English or
Scandinavian blood; on the other side he was of
Scotch and English descent, counting Jones, Dunbar,
and Burns among his feminine ancestors. Liveliness
and humor came to him from his Scotch connection;
from father and grandfather he inherited a grave
steadiness of mind rather at variance with his mother's
vivacity. Manual dexterity was also inherited; so that
he practiced the simpler mechanic arts with ease and
skill; his mathematical training and his outdoor habits
fitted him for a land-surveyor; and by that art, as well
as by pencil-making, lecturing, and writing, he paid
his way in the world, and left a small income from his
writings to those who survived him. He taught pupils
also, as did his brother and sisters; but it was not an
occupation that he long followed after John's death in
1842. With these introductory statements we may proceed
to Thoreau's first correspondence with his brother
and sisters.</p>

<p>As an introduction to the correspondence, and a key
to the young man's view of life, a passage may be taken
from Thoreau's "part" at his college commencement,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
August 16, 1837. He was one of two to hold what was
called a "Conference" on "The Commercial Spirit,"&mdash;his
alternative or opponent in the dispute being
Henry Vose, also of Concord, who, in later years, was a
Massachusetts judge. Henry Thoreau,<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
 then just twenty,
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The characteristic of our epoch is perfect freedom,&mdash;freedom
of thought and action. The indignant
Greek, the oppressed Pole, the jealous American assert
it. The skeptic no less than the believer, the heretic no
less than the faithful child of the church, have begun
to enjoy it. It has generated an unusual degree of
energy and activity; it has generated the <i>commercial
spirit</i>. Man thinks faster and freer than ever before.
He, moreover, moves faster and freer. He is more restless,
because he is more independent than ever. The
winds and the waves are not enough for him; he must
needs ransack the bowels of the earth, that he may
make for himself a highway of iron over its surface.</p>

<p>"Indeed, could one examine this beehive of ours
from an observatory among the stars, he would perceive
an unwonted degree of bustle in these later
ages. There would be hammering and chipping in
one quarter; baking and brewing, buying and selling,
money-changing and speechmaking in another. What
impression would he receive from so general and impartial
a survey. Would it appear to him that mankind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
used this world as not abusing it? Doubtless he would
first be struck with the profuse beauty of our orb; he
would never tire of admiring its varied zones and seasons,
with their changes of living. He could not but
notice that restless animal for whose sake it was contrived;
but where he found one man to admire with
him his fair dwelling-place, the ninety and nine would
be scraping together a little of the gilded dust upon its
surface.... We are to look chiefly for the origin of
the commercial spirit, and the power that still cherishes
and sustains it, in a blind and unmanly love of wealth.
Wherever this exists, it is too sure to become the ruling
spirit; and, as a natural consequence, it infuses into
all our thoughts and affections a degree of its own selfishness;
we become selfish in our patriotism, selfish in
our domestic relations, selfish in our religion.</p>

<p>"Let men, true to their natures, cultivate the moral
affections, lead manly and independent lives; let them
make riches the means and not the end of existence,
and we shall hear no more of the commercial spirit.
The sea will not stagnate, the earth will be as green as
ever, and the air as pure. This curious world which
we inhabit is more wonderful than it is convenient;
more beautiful than it is useful; it is more to be admired
and enjoyed than used. The order of things
should be somewhat reversed; the seventh should be
man's day of toil, wherein to earn his living by the
sweat of his brow; and the other six his Sabbath of
the affections and the soul,&mdash;in which to range this
widespread garden, and drink in the soft influences
and sublime revelations of Nature.... The spirit we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
are considering is not altogether and without exception
bad. We rejoice in it as one more indication of the
entire and universal freedom that characterizes the age
in which we live,&mdash;as an indication that the human
race is making one more advance in that infinite series
of progressions which awaits it. We glory in those
very excesses which are a source of anxiety to the wise
and good; as an evidence that man will not always be
the slave of matter,&mdash;but ere long, casting off those
earth-born desires which identify him with the brute,
shall pass the days of his sojourn in this his nether
paradise, as becomes the Lord of Creation."<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span></p>

<p>This passage is noteworthy as showing how early the
philosophic mind was developed in Thoreau, and how
much his thought and expression were influenced by
Emerson's first book,&mdash;"Nature." But the soil in
which that germinating seed fell was naturally prepared
to receive it; and the wide diversity between the master
and the disciple soon began to appear. In 1863, reviewing
Thoreau's work, Emerson said, "That oaken
strength which I noted whenever he walked or worked,
or surveyed wood-lots,&mdash;the same unhesitating hand
with which a field-laborer accosts a piece of work which
I should shun as a waste of strength, Henry shows in
his literary task. He has muscle, and ventures on and
performs feats which I am forced to decline. In reading
him I find the same thoughts, the same spirit that
is in me; but he takes a step beyond, and illustrates by
excellent images that which I should have conveyed in
a sleepy generalization." True as this is, it omits one
point of difference only too well known to Emerson,&mdash;the
controversial turn of Thoreau's mind, in which he
was so unlike Emerson and Alcott, and which must
have given to his youthful utterances in company the
air of something requiring an apology.</p>

<p>This, at all events, seems to have been the feeling of
Helen Thoreau,<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
 whose pride in her brother was such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
that she did not wish to see him misunderstood. A
pleasing indication of both these traits is seen in the
first extant letter of Thoreau to this sister. I have this
in an autograph copy made by Mr. Emerson, when he
was preparing the letters for partial publication, soon
after Henry's death. For some reason he did not insert
it in his volume; but it quite deserves to be printed, as
indicating the period when it was clear to Thoreau that
he must think for himself, whatever those around him
might think.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO HELEN THOREAU (AT TAUNTON).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, October 27, 1837.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Helen</span>,&mdash;Please you, let the defendant say a
few words in defense of his long silence. You know we
have hardly done our own deeds, thought our own
thoughts, or lived our own lives hitherto. For a man to
act himself, he must be perfectly free; otherwise he is
in danger of losing all sense of responsibility or of self-respect.
Now when such a state of things exists, that
the sacred opinions one advances in argument are
apologized for by his friends, before his face, lest his
hearers receive a wrong impression of the man,&mdash;when
such gross injustice is of frequent occurrence, where
shall we look, and not look in vain, for men, deeds,
thoughts? As well apologize for the grape that it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
sour, or the thunder that it is noisy, or the lightning
that it tarries not.</p>

<p>Further, letter-writing too often degenerates into a
communicating of facts, and not of truths; of other
men's deeds and not our thoughts. What are the convulsions
of a planet, compared with the emotions of the
soul? or the rising of a thousand suns, if that is not
enlightened by a ray?</p>

<p class="left45">
Your affectionate brother,<br />
<span class="smcap i4">Henry</span>.</p>

<p>It is presumed the tender sister did not need a second
lesson; and equally that Henry did not see fit always
to write such letters as he praised above,&mdash;for he was
quite ready to give his correspondents facts, no less than
thoughts, especially in his family letters.</p>

<p>Next to this epistle, chronologically, comes one in the
conventional dialect of the American Indian, as handed
down by travelers and romancers, by Jefferson, Chateaubriand,
Lewis, Clarke, and Fenimore Cooper. John
Thoreau, Henry's brother, was born in 1815 and died
January 11, 1842. He was teaching at Taunton in 1837.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO JOHN THOREAU (AT TAUNTON).</p>

<p class="center">(Written as from one Indian to another.)</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Musketaquid</span>, 202 Summers, two Moons, eleven Suns,<br />
since the coming of the Pale Faces.<br />
(November 11, 1837.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tahatawan</span>, Sachimaussan, to his brother sachem,
Hopeful of Hopewell,&mdash;hoping that he is well:&mdash;</p>

<p>Brother: It is many suns that I have not seen the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
print of thy moccasins by our council-fire; the Great
Spirit has blown more leaves from the trees, and many
clouds from the land of snows have visited our lodge;
the earth has become hard, like a frozen buffalo-skin,
so that the trampling of many herds is like the Great
Spirit's thunder; the grass on the great fields is like the
old man of many winters, and the small song sparrow
prepares for his flight to the land whence the summer
comes.</p>

<p>Brother: I write these things because I know that
thou lovest the Great Spirit's creatures, and wast wont
to sit at thy lodge-door, when the maize was green, to
hear the bluebird's song. So shalt thou, in the land of
spirits, not only find good hunting-grounds and sharp
arrowheads, but much music of birds.</p>

<p>Brother: I have been thinking how the Pale-Faces
have taken away our lands,&mdash;and was a woman. You
are fortunate to have pitched your wigwam nearer to
the great salt lake, where the Pale-Face can never
plant corn.</p>

<p>Brother: I need not tell thee how we hunted on the
lands of the Dundees,&mdash;a great war-chief never forgets
the bitter taunts of his enemies. Our young men
called for strong water; they painted their faces and
dug up the hatchet. But their enemies, the Dundees,
were women; they hastened to cover their hatchets
with wampum. Our braves are not many; our enemies
took a few strings from the heap their fathers left them,
and our hatchets are buried. But not Tahatawan's;
his heart is of rock when the Dundees sing,&mdash;his
hatchet cuts deep into the Dundee braves.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span></p>

<p>Brother: There is dust on my moccasins; I have
journeyed to the White Lake, in the country of the
Ninares.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
 The Long-Knife has been there,&mdash;like a
woman I paddled his war-canoe. But the spirits of my
fathers were angered; the waters were ruffled, and the
Bad Spirit troubled the air.</p>

<p>The hearts of the Lee-vites are gladdened; the
young Peacock has returned to his lodge at Naushawtuck.
He is the Medicine of his tribe, but his heart is
like the dry leaves when the whirlwind breathes. He
has come to help choose new chiefs for the tribe, in the
great council-house, when two suns are past.&mdash;There
is no seat for Tahatawan in the council-house. He lets
the squaws talk,&mdash;his voice is heard above the war-whoop
of his tribe, piercing the hearts of his foes; his
legs are stiff, he cannot sit.</p>

<p>Brother: Art thou waiting for the spring, that the
geese may fly low over thy wigwam? Thy arrows are
sharp, thy bow is strong. Has Anawan killed all the
eagles? The crows fear not the winter. Tahatawan's
eyes are sharp,&mdash;he can track a snake in the grass, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
knows a friend from a foe; he welcomes a friend to his
lodge though the ravens croak.</p>

<p>Brother: Hast thou studied much in the medicine-books
of the Pale-Faces? Dost thou understand the
long talk of the Medicine whose words are like the
music of the mockingbird? But our chiefs have not
ears to hear him; they listen like squaws to the council
of old men,&mdash;they understand not his words. But,
Brother, he never danced the war-dance, nor heard the
war-whoop of his enemies. He was a squaw; he stayed
by the wigwam when the braves were out, and tended
the tame buffaloes.</p>

<p>Fear not; the Dundees have faint hearts and much
wampum. When the grass is green on the Great Fields,
and the small titmouse returns again, we will hunt the
buffalo together.</p>

<p>Our old men say they will send the young chief of
the Karlisles, who lives in the green wigwam and is a
great Medicine, that his word may be heard in the long
talk which the wise men are going to hold at Shawmut,
by the salt lake. He is a great talk, and will not forget
the enemies of his tribe.</p>

<p>14th Sun. The fire has gone out in the council-house.
The words of our old men have been like the
vaunts of the Dundees. The Eagle-Beak was moved to
talk like a silly Pale-Face, and not as becomes a great
war-chief in a council of braves. The young Peacock
is a woman among braves; he heard not the words of
the old men,&mdash;like a squaw he looked at his medicine-paper.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>

The young chief of the green wigwam has hung
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
up his moccasins; he will not leave his tribe till after
the buffalo have come down on to the plains.</p>

<p>Brother: This is a long talk, but there is much
meaning to my words; they are not like the thunder of
canes when the lightning smites them. Brother, I have
just heard <i>thy talk</i> and am well pleased; thou art
getting to be a great Medicine. The Great Spirit confound
the enemies of thy tribe.</p>

<p class="left65">
<span class="smcap i3">Tahatawan.</span><br />
His mark [a bow and arrow].</p>

<p>This singular letter was addressed to John Thoreau
at Taunton, and was so carefully preserved in the
family that it must have had value in their eyes, as recalling
traits of the two Thoreau brothers, and also
events in the village life of Concord, more interesting
to the young people of 1837 than to the present generation.
Some of its parables are easy to read, others
quite obscure. The annual State election was an important
event to Henry Thoreau then,&mdash;more so than
it afterwards appeared; and he was certainly on the
Whig side in politics, like most of the educated youths
of Concord. His "young chief of the Karlisles" was
Albert Nelson, son of a Carlisle physician, who began
to practice law in Concord in 1836, and was afterwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
chief justice of the Superior Court of the County of
Suffolk. He was defeated at the election of 1837, as
a Whig candidate for the legislature, by a Democrat.
Henry Vose, above named, writing from "Butternuts,"
in New York, three hundred miles west of Concord,
October 22, 1837, said to Thoreau: "You envy my
happy situation, and mourn over your fate, which condemns
you to loiter about Concord and grub among
clamshells [for Indian relics]. If this were your only
source of enjoyment while in Concord,&mdash;but I know
that it is not. I well remember that 'antique and fish-like'
office of <i>Major</i> Nelson (to whom, and to Mr.
Dennis, and Bemis, and John Thoreau, I wish to be
remembered); and still more vividly do I remember
the fairer portion of the community in C." This indicates
a social habit in Henry and John Thoreau, which
the Indian "talk" also implies. Tahatawan, whom
Henry here impersonated, was the mythical Sachem of
Musketaquid (the Algonquin name for Concord River
and region), whose fishing and hunting lodge was on
the hill Naushawtuck, between the two rivers so much
navigated by the Thoreaus. In 1837 the two brothers
were sportsmen, and went shooting over the Concord
meadows and moors, but of course the "buffalo" was
a figure of speech; they never shot anything larger than
a raccoon. A few years later they gave up killing the
game.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO JOHN THOREAU (AT TAUNTON).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, February 10, 1838.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear John,</span>&mdash;Dost expect to elicit a spark from so
dull a steel as myself, by that flinty subject of thine?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
Truly, one of your copper percussion caps would have
fitted this nail-head better.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the "Americana"<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
 has hardly two
words on the subject. The process is very simple. The
stone is struck with a mallet so as to produce pieces
sharp at one end, and blunt at the other. These are
laid upon a steel line (probably a chisel's edge), and
again struck with the mallet, and flints of the required
size are broken off. A skillful workman may make a
thousand in a day.</p>

<p>So much for the "Americana." Dr. Jacob Bigelow
in his "Technology," says, "Gunflints are formed by a
skillful workman, who breaks them out with a hammer,
a roller, and steel chisel, with small, repeated strokes."</p>

<p>Your ornithological commission shall be executed.
When are you coming home?</p>

<p class="left45">
Your affectionate brother,<br />

<p class="center p2">TO JOHN THOREAU (AT TAUNTON).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, March 17, 1838.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear John</span>,&mdash;Your box of relics came safe to hand,
but was speedily deposited on the carpet, I assure you.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
What could it be? Some declared it must be Taunton
herrings: "Just nose it, sir!" So down we went on to
our knees, and commenced smelling in good earnest,&mdash;now
horizontally from this corner to that, now perpendicularly
from the carpet up, now diagonally,&mdash;and
finally with a sweeping movement describing the circumference.
But it availed not. Taunton herring would
not be smelled. So we e'en proceeded to open it <i>vi et
chisel</i>. What an array of nails! Four nails make a
quarter, four quarters a yard,&mdash;i' faith, this is n't cloth
measure! Blaze away, old boy! Clap in another wedge,
then! There, softly! she begins to gape. Just give that
old stickler, with a black hat on, another hoist. Aye,
we'll pare his nails for him! Well done, old fellow,
there's a breathing-hole for you. "Drive it in!" cries
one; "Nip it off!" cries another. Be easy, I say.
What's done may be undone. Your richest veins don't
lie nearest the surface. Suppose we sit down and enjoy
the prospect, for who knows but we may be disappointed?
When they opened Pandora's box, all the
contents escaped except Hope, but in this case hope is
uppermost, and will be the first to escape when the box
is opened. However, the general voice was for kicking
the coverlid off.</p>

<p>The relics have been arranged numerically on a
table. When shall we set up housekeeping? Miss
Ward thanks you for her share of the spoils; also accept
many thanks from your humble servant "for
yourself."</p>

<p>I have a proposal to make. Suppose by the time you
are released we should start in company for the West,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
and there either establish a school jointly, or procure
ourselves separate situations. Suppose, moreover, you
should get ready to start previous to leaving Taunton,
to save time. Go <i>I</i> must, at all events. Dr. Jarvis
enumerates nearly a dozen schools which I could have,&mdash;all
such as would suit you equally well.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
 I wish you
would write soon about this. It is high season to start.
The canals are now open, and traveling comparatively
cheap. I think I can borrow the cash in this town.
There's nothing like trying.</p>

<p>Brigham wrote you a few words on the 8th, which
father took the liberty to read, with the advice and
consent of the family. He wishes you to send him those
[numbers] of the "Library of Health" received since
1838, if you are in Concord; otherwise, he says you
need not trouble yourself about it at present. He is in
C., and enjoying better health than usual. But one
number, and that you have, has been received.</p>

<p>One remark in this letter calls for attention,&mdash;that
concerning the "bluebird-box" for Mr. Emerson. In
1853 Emerson wrote in his journal: "Long ago I wrote
of Gifts, and neglected a capital example. John Thoreau,
Jr., one day put a bluebird's box on my barn,&mdash;fifteen
years ago it must be,&mdash;and there it still is, with
every summer a melodious family in it, adorning the
place and singing his praises. There's a gift for you,&mdash;which
cost the giver no money, but nothing which he
bought could have been so good. I think of another,
quite inestimable. John Thoreau knew how much I
should value a head of little Waldo, then five years old.
He came to me and offered to take him to a daguerreotypist
who was then in town, and he (Thoreau) would
see it well done. He did it, and brought me the daguerre,
which I thankfully paid for. A few months
after, my boy died; and I have since to thank John
Thoreau for that wise and gentle piece of friendship."</p>

<p>Little Waldo Emerson died January 27, 1842, and
John Thoreau the same month; so that this taking of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
the portrait must have been but a few months before
his own death, January 11. Henry Thoreau was then
living in the Emerson family.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO JOHN THOREAU (AT WEST ROXBURY).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, July 8, 1838.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear John</span>,&mdash;We heard from Helen to-day, and
she informs us that you are coming home by the first
of August. Now I wish you to write and let me know
exactly when your vacation takes place, that I may take
one at the same time. I am in school from 8 to 12 in
the morning, and from 2 to 4 in the afternoon. After
that I read a little Greek or English, or, for variety,
take a stroll in the fields. We have not had such a year
for berries this long time,&mdash;the earth is actually blue
with them. High blueberries, three kinds of low, thimble- and
raspberries constitute my diet at present.
(Take notice,&mdash;I only diet between meals.) Among
my deeds of charity, I may reckon the picking of a
cherry tree for two helpless single ladies, who live under
the hill; but i' faith, it was robbing Peter to pay Paul,&mdash;for
while I was exalted in charity towards them, I
had no mercy on my own stomach. Be advised, my
love for currants continues.</p>

<p>The only addition that I have made to my stock of
ornithological information is in the shape not of a
<i>Fring. melod.</i>,&mdash;but surely a melodious Fringilla,&mdash;the
<i>F. juncorum</i>, or rush-sparrow. I had long known
him by note, but never by name.</p>

<p>Report says that Elijah Stearns is going to take the
town school. I have four scholars, and one more engaged.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
Mr. Fenner left town yesterday. Among occurrences
of ill omen may be mentioned the falling out
and cracking of the inscription stone of Concord Monument.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>

Mrs. Lowell and children are at Aunts'. Peabody
[a college classmate] walked up last Wednesday,
spent the night, and took a stroll in the woods.</p>

<p>Sophia says I must leave off and pen a few lines for
her to Helen: so good-by. Love from all, and among
them your aff. brother,</p>

<p>The school above mentioned as begun by Henry
Thoreau in this summer of 1838 was joined in by John,
after finishing his teaching at West Roxbury, and was
continued for several years. It was in this school that
Louisa Alcott and her sister received some instruction,
after their father removed from Boston to Concord, in
the spring of 1840. It was opened in the Parkman
house, where the family then lived, and soon after was
transferred to the building of the Concord Academy,<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>

not far off. John Thoreau taught the English branches
and mathematics; Henry taught Latin and Greek and
the higher mathematics,&mdash;and it was the custom of
both brothers to go walking with their pupils one afternoon
each week. It is as a professional schoolmaster
that Henry thus writes to his sister Helen, then teaching
at Roxbury, after a like experience in Taunton.

<p class="center p2">TO HELEN THOREAU (AT ROXBURY).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, October 6, 1838.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Helen</span>,&mdash;I dropped Sophia's letter into the
box immediately on taking yours out, else the tone of
the former had been changed.</p>

<p>I have no acquaintance with "Cleaveland's First
Lessons," though I have peeped into his abridged
grammar, which I should think very well calculated
for beginners,&mdash;at least for such as would be likely to
wear out one book before they would be prepared for
the abstruser parts of grammar. Ahem!</p>

<p>As no one can tell what was the Roman pronunciation,
each nation makes the Latin conform, for the most
part, to the rules of its own language; so that with us
of the vowels only A has a peculiar sound. In the end
of a word of more than one syllable it is sounded like
"ah," as <i>pennah</i>, <i>Lydiah</i>, <i>Hannah</i>, etc., without regard
to case; but "<i>da</i>" is never sounded "<i>dah</i>," because it
is a monosyllable. All terminations in <i>es</i>, and plural
cases in <i>os</i>, as you know, are pronounced long,&mdash;as
<i>homines</i> (hominese), <i>dominos</i> (dominose), or, in English,
<i>Johnny Vose</i>. For information, see Adams' "Latin
Grammar," before the Rudiments.</p>

<p>This is all law and gospel in the eyes of the world;
but remember I am speaking, as it were, in the third
person, and should sing quite a different tune if it were
I that had made the quire. However, one must occasionally
hang his harp on the willows, and play on the
Jew's harp, in such a strange country as this.</p>

<p>One of your young ladies wishes to study mental
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
philosophy, hey? Well, tell her that she has the very
best text-book that I know of in her possession already.
If she do not believe it, then she should have bespoken
another better in another world, and not have expected
to find one at "Little &amp; Wilkins." But if she wishes
to know how poor an apology for a mental philosophy
men have tacked together, synthetically or analytically,
in these latter days,&mdash;how they have squeezed the infinite
mind into a compass that would not nonplus a
surveyor of Eastern Lands&mdash;making Imagination and
Memory to lie still in their respective apartments like
ink-stand and wafers in a lady's escritoire,&mdash;why let
her read Locke, or Stewart, or Brown. The fact is,
mental philosophy is very like Poverty, which, you
know, begins at home; and indeed, when it goes abroad,
it is poverty itself.</p>

<p><i>Chorus.</i> I should think an abridgment of one of the
above authors, or of Ambercrombie, would answer her
purpose. It may set her a-thinking. Probably there
are many systems in the market of which I am ignorant.</p>

<p>As for themes, say first "Miscellaneous Thoughts."
Set one up to a window, to note what passes in the
street, and make her comments thereon; or let her
gaze in the fire, or into a corner where there is a
spider's web, and philosophize, moralize, theorize, or
what not. What their hands find to putter about, or
their minds to think about, that let them write about.
To say nothing of advantage or disadvantage of this,
that, or the other, let them set down their ideas at any
given season, preserving the chain of thought as complete
as may be.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span></p>

<p>This is the style pedagogical. I am much obliged to
you for your piece of information. Knowing your dislike
to a sentimental letter, I remain</p>

<p class="left45">
Your affectionate brother,<br />

<p>The next letter to Helen carries this pedagogical
style a little farther, for it is in Latin, addressed "Ad
Helenam L. Thoreau, Roxbury, Mass.," and postmarked
"Concord, Jan. 25" (1840).</p>

<p>Barring a few slips, this is a good and lively piece of

<p class="center p2">VERNACULAR VERSION.</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, January 23, 1840.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sister</span>,&mdash;There is a huge snow-drift at the
door, and the cold inside is intolerable. The very sky
is coming down, I guess, and covering up the ground.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
I turn out late in the morning, and go to bed early;
there is thick frost on the windows, shutting out the
view; and here I write in pain, for fingers and brains
are numb. I would chant with Horace, if my voice did
not stick in my throat,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><p>See how Naushawtuct, deep in snow,</p>
<p>Stands glittering, while the bending woods</p>
<p>Scarce bear their burden, and the floods</p>
<p>Feel arctic winter stay their flow.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Pile on the firewood, melt the cold,</p>
<p>Spare nothing, etc.</p></div></div></div>

<p>But soon, changing my tune, and with a cheerfuller
note, I'll say,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><p>No longer the flock huddles up in the stall, the plowman bends over the fire,</p>
<p>No longer frost whitens the meadow;</p>
<p>But the goddess of love, while the moon shines above,</p>
<p>Sets us dancing in light and in shadow.</p></div></div>

<p>When Robin Redbreast brings back the springtime,
I trust that you will lay your school duties aside, cast
off care, and venture to be gay now and then; roaming
with me in the woods, or climbing the Fair Haven cliffs,&mdash;or
else, in my boat on Walden, let the water kiss
your hand, or gaze at your image in the wave.</p>

<p>Bulwer is to me a name unknown,&mdash;one of the unnoticed
crowd, attracting neither blame nor praise. To
be sure, I hold any one in some esteem who is helpless
in the grasp of the writing demon.</p>

<p>Does not the image of the Lexington afire trouble
your dreams?<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
 But we may not, like the superstitious

mob, blame Vulcan or Neptune,&mdash;neither fire nor
water was in fault. Nature takes as much care for
midgets as for mankind; she is our friend in storm and
in calm.</p>

<p>If you like history, and the exploits of the brave,
don't give up Rollin, I beg; thus would you displease
Clio, who might not forgive you hereafter. What Latin
are you reading? I mean <i>reading</i>, not studying.
Blessed is the man who can have his library at hand,
and oft peruse the books, without the fear of a taskmaster!
he is far enough from harmful idleness, who
can call in and dismiss these friends when he pleases.
An honest book's the noblest work of man. There's a
reason, now, not only for your reading, but for writing
something, too. You will not lack readers,&mdash;here am
I, for one. If you cannot compose a volume, then try a
tract. It will do the world no good, hereafter, if you
merely exist, and pass life smoothly or roughly; but to
have thoughts, and write them down, that helps greatly.</p>

<p>I fear you will tire of this epistle; the light of day is
dwindling, too,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
And longer fall the shadows of the hills.</p></div>

<p>Therefore, good-by; fare ye well, and sleep in quiet,

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sophia</span>,&mdash;Sam Black [the cat] is liable to
frequent attacks that impair his agility and good-nature;
at such times he goes down cellar, and stays many
hours. Your flowers&mdash;O, the cruel frost!&mdash;are all but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
dead; the cactus is withered by cold, but the geraniums
yet flourish. The Sewing Circle has been revived this
winter; they meet at our house in April or May, so
that you may then be here. Your Aunt Sophia remains
with us,&mdash;when she will return to the city I don't
know. We still suffer from heavy colds, but not so
much. Young Miss E. White is staying in the village a
little while (is making a little visit in town). Don't forget
to write within two weeks. We expect a letter next
Sunday.</p>

<p>That you may enjoy good health is the prayer of</p>

<p class="left45">
Your mother,<br />
<span class="smcap i4">C. Thoreau</span>.</p>

<p>(H. D. T. was the scribe.)</p>

<p>Cats were always an important branch of the Thoreaus'
domestic economy, and Henry was more tolerant
of them than men are wont to be. Flowers were the
specialty of Sophia, who, when I knew her, from 1855
to 1876, usually had a small conservatory in a recess of
the dining-room. At this time (1840) she seems to have
been aiding Helen in her school. The next letter, to
Helen, is of a graver tone:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center p2">TO HELEN THOREAU (AT ROXBURY).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, June 13, 1840.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Helen</span>,&mdash;That letter to John, for which you
had an opportunity doubtless to substitute a more perfect
communication, fell, as was natural, into the hands
of his "transcendental brother," who is his proxy in
such cases, having been commissioned to acknowledge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
and receipt all bills that may be presented. But what's
in a name? Perhaps it does not matter whether it be
John or Henry. Nor will those same six months have
to be altered, I fear, to suit his case as well. But
methinks they have not passed entirely without intercourse,
provided we have been sincere though humble
worshipers of the same virtue in the mean time. Certainly
it is better that we should make ourselves quite
sure of such a communion as this by the only course
which is completely free from suspicion,&mdash;the coincidence
of two earnest and aspiring lives,&mdash;than run the
risk of a disappointment by relying wholly or chiefly on
so meagre and uncertain a means as speech, whether
written or spoken, affords. How often, when we have
been nearest each other bodily, have we really been
farthest off! Our tongues were the witty foils with
which we fenced each other off. Not that we have not
met heartily and with profit as members of one family,
but it was a small one surely, and not that other human
family. We have met frankly and without concealment
ever, as befits those who have an instinctive trust in one
another, and the scenery of whose outward lives has
been the same, but never as prompted by an earnest
and affectionate desire to probe deeper our mutual
natures. Such intercourse, at least, if it has ever been,
has not condescended to the vulgarities of oral communication,
for the ears are provided with no lid as the
eye is, and would not have been deaf to it in sleep. And
now glad am I, if I am not mistaken in imagining that
some such transcendental inquisitiveness has traveled
post <i>thither</i>,&mdash;for, as I observed before, where the bolt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
hits, thither was it aimed,&mdash;any arbitrary direction
notwithstanding.</p>

<p>Thus much, at least, our <i>kindred</i> temperament of
mind and body&mdash;and long <i>family</i>-arity&mdash;have done
for us, that we already find ourselves standing on a
solid and natural footing with respect to one another,
and shall not have to waste time in the so often unavailing
endeavor to arrive fairly at this simple ground.</p>

<p>Let us leave trifles, then, to accident; and politics,
and finance, and such gossip, to the moments when
diet and exercise are cared for, and speak to each other
deliberately as out of one infinity into another,&mdash;you
there in time and space, and I here. For beside this
relation, all books and doctrines are no better than
gossip or the turning of a spit.</p>

<p>Equally to you and Sophia, from</p>

<p class="left45">
Your affectionate brother,<br />
<span class="smcap i4">H. D. Thoreau</span>.</p>

<p>We come now to the period when Thoreau entered
on more intimate relations with Emerson. There was
a difference of fourteen years in their ages, which had
hitherto separated them intellectually; but now the
young scholar, thinker, and naturalist had so fast
advanced that he could meet his senior on more equal
terms, and each became essential to the other. With all
his prudence and common sense, in which he surpassed
most men, Emerson was yet lacking in some practical
faculties; while Thoreau was the most practical and
handy person in all matters of every-day life,&mdash;a good
mechanic and gardener, methodical in his habits, observant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
and kindly in the domestic world, and attractive
to children, who now were important members of the
Emerson household. He was therefore invited by Emerson
to make his house a home,&mdash;looking after the garden,
the business affairs, and performing the office of a
younger brother or a grown-up son. The invitation
was accepted in April, 1841, and Thoreau remained in
the family, with frequent absences, until he went in
May, 1843, to reside with Mr. William Emerson, near
New York, as the tutor of his sons. During these two
years much occurred of deep moment to the two friends.
Young Waldo Emerson, the beautiful boy, died, and
just before, John Thoreau, the sunny and hopeful
brother, whom Henry seems to have loved more than
any human being. These tragedies brought the bereaved
nearer together, and gave to Mrs. Emerson in
particular an affection for Thoreau and a trust in him
which made the intimate life of the household move
harmoniously, notwithstanding the independent and
eccentric genius of Thoreau.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO MRS. LUCY BROWN<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
 (AT PLYMOUTH).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, July 21, 1841.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;Don't think I need any prompting
to write to you; but what tough earthenware shall I
put into my packet to travel over so many hills, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
thrid so many woods, as lie between Concord and Plymouth?
Thank fortune it is all the way down hill, so
they will get safely carried; and yet it seems as if it
were writing against time and the sun to send a letter
east, for no natural force forwards it. You should go
dwell in the West, and then I would deluge you with
letters, as boys throw feathers into the air to see the
wind take them. I should rather fancy you at evening
dwelling far away behind the serene curtain of the
West,&mdash;the home of fair weather,&mdash;than over by the
chilly sources of the east wind.</p>

<p>What quiet thoughts have you nowadays which will
float on that east wind to west, for so we may make our
worst servants our carriers,&mdash;what progress made from
<i>can't</i> to <i>can</i>, in practice and theory? Under this category,
you remember, we used to place all our philosophy.
Do you have any still, startling, well moments,
in which you think grandly, and speak with emphasis?
Don't take this for sarcasm, for not in a year of the
gods, I fear, will such a golden approach to plain
speaking revolve again. But away with such fears; by a
few miles of travel we have not distanced each other's
sincerity.</p>

<p>I grow savager and savager every day, as if fed on
raw meat, and my tameness is only the repose of untamableness.
I dream of looking abroad summer and
winter, with free gaze, from some mountain-side, while
my eyes revolve in an Egyptian slime of health,&mdash;I to
be nature looking into nature with such easy sympathy
as the blue-eyed grass in the meadow looks in the face
of the sky. From some such recess I would put forth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
sublime thoughts daily, as the plant puts forth leaves.
Now-a-nights I go on to the hill to see the sun set, as
one would go home at evening; the bustle of the village
has run on all day, and left me quite in the rear;
but I see the sunset, and find that it can wait for my
slow virtue.</p>

<p>But I forget that you think more of this human
nature than of this nature I praise. Why won't you
believe that mine is more human than any single man
or woman can be? that in it, in the sunset there, are
all the qualities that can adorn a household, and that
sometimes, in a fluttering leaf, one may hear all your
Christianity preached.</p>

<p>You see how unskillful a letter-writer I am, thus to
have come to the end of my sheet when hardly arrived
at the beginning of my story. I was going to be
soberer, I assure you, but now have only room to add,
that if the fates allot you a serene hour, don't fail to
communicate some of its serenity to your friend,</p>

<p class="left65">
<span class="smcap">Henry D. Thoreau</span>.</p>

<p>No, no. Improve so rare a gift for yourself, and
send me of your leisure.</p>

<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, Wednesday evening,<br />
<span class="i2">September 8, [1841.]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;Your note came wafted to my
hand like the first leaf of the fall on the September
wind, and I put only another interpretation upon its
lines than upon the veins of those which are soon to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
be strewed around me. It is nothing but Indian summer
here at present. I mean that any weather seems
reserved expressly for our late purposes whenever we
happen to be fulfilling them. I do not know what
right I have to so much happiness, but rather hold it
in reserve till the time of my desert.</p>

<p>What with the crickets and the crowing of cocks,
and the lowing of kine, our Concord life is sonorous
enough. Sometimes I hear the cock bestir himself on
his perch under my feet, and crow shrilly before dawn;
and I think I might have been born any year for all
the phenomena I know. We count sixteen eggs daily
now, when arithmetic will only fetch the hens up to
thirteen; but the world is young, and we wait to see
this eccentricity complete its period.</p>

<p>My verses on Friendship are already printed in the
<i>Dial</i>; not expanded, but reduced to completeness by
leaving out the long lines, which always have, or should
have, a longer or at least another sense than short
ones.</p>

<p>Just now I am in the mid-sea of verses, and they
actually rustle around me as the leaves would round
the head of Autumnus himself should he thrust it up
through some vales which I know; but, alas! many of
them are but crisped and yellow leaves like his, I fear,
and will deserve no better fate than to make mould
for new harvests. I see the stanzas rise around me,
verse upon verse, far and near, like the mountains
from Agiocochook, not all having a terrestrial existence
as yet, even as some of them may be clouds; but
I fancy I see the gleam of some Sebago Lake and Silver
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
Cascade, at whose well I may drink one day. I am
as unfit for any practical purpose&mdash;I mean for the
furtherance of the world's ends&mdash;as gossamer for ship-timber;
and I, who am going to be a pencil-maker
to-morrow,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
 can sympathize with God Apollo, who
served King Admetus for a while on earth. But I
believe he found it for his advantage at last,&mdash;as I am
sure I shall, though I shall hold the nobler part at
least out of the service.</p>

<p>Don't attach any undue seriousness to this threnody,
for I love my fate to the very core and rind, and could
swallow it without paring it, I think. You ask if I have
written any more poems? Excepting those which Vulcan
is now forging, I have only discharged a few more
bolts into the horizon,&mdash;in all, three hundred verses&mdash;and
sent them, as I may say, over the mountains to
Miss Fuller, who may have occasion to remember the
old rhyme:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><p class="o1">"Three scipen gode</p>
<p>Comen mid than flode</p>
<p>Three hundred cnihten."</p></div></div>

<p>But these are far more Vandalic than they. In this
narrow sheet there is not room even for one thought to
root itself. But you must consider this an odd leaf of a
volume, and that volume</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, October 5, 1841.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;I send you Williams's<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
 letter as the
last remembrancer to one of those "whose acquaintance
he had the pleasure to form while in Concord."
It came quite unexpectedly to me, but I was very glad
to receive it, though I hardly know whether my utmost
sincerity and interest can inspire a sufficient answer to
it. I should like to have you send it back by some
convenient opportunity.</p>

<p>Pray let me know what you are thinking about any
day,&mdash;what most nearly concerns you. Last winter, you
know, you did more than your share of the talking, and
I did not complain for want of an opportunity. Imagine
your stove-door out of order, at least, and then while
I am fixing it you will think of enough things to say.</p>

<p>What makes the value of your life at present? what
dreams have you, and what realizations? You know
there is a high table-land which not even the east wind
reaches. Now can't we walk and chat upon its plane
still, as if there were no lower latitudes? Surely our
two destinies are topics interesting and grand enough
for any occasion.</p>

<p>I hope you have many gleams of serenity and health,
or, if your body will grant you no positive respite, that
you may, at any rate, enjoy your sickness occasionally,
as much as I used to tell of. But here is the bundle

<p class="center p2">TO MRS. LUCY BROWN (AT PLYMOUTH).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, March 2, 1842.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;I believe I have nothing new to
tell you, for what was news you have learned from
other sources. I am much the same person that I was,
who should be so much better; yet when I realize what
has transpired, and the greatness of the part I am unconsciously
acting, I am thrilled, and it seems as if
there were none in history to match it.</p>

<p>Soon after John's death I listened to a music-box,
and if, at any time, that event had seemed inconsistent
with the beauty and harmony of the universe, it was
then gently constrained into the placid course of nature
by those steady notes, in mild and unoffended tone
echoing far and wide under the heavens. But I find
these things more strange than sad to me. What right
have I to grieve, who have not ceased to wonder? We
feel at first as if some opportunities of kindness and
sympathy were lost, but learn afterward that any <i>pure
grief</i> is ample recompense for all. That is, if we are
faithful; for a great grief is but sympathy with the soul
that disposes events, and is as natural as the resin on
Arabian trees. Only Nature has a right to grieve perpetually,
for she only is innocent. Soon the ice will
melt, and the blackbirds sing along the river which he
frequented, as pleasantly as ever. The same everlasting
serenity will appear in this face of God, and we will
not be sorrowful if he is not.</p>

<p>We are made happy when reason can discover no
occasion for it. The memory of some past moments is
more persuasive than the experience of present ones.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
There have been visions of such breadth and brightness
that these motes were invisible in their light.</p>

<p>I do not wish to see John ever again,&mdash;I mean him
who is dead,&mdash;but that other, whom only he would
have wished to see, or to be, of whom he was the imperfect
representative. For we are not what we are,
nor do we treat or esteem each other for such, but for
what we are capable of being.</p>

<p>As for Waldo, he died as the mist rises from the
brook, which the sun will soon dart his rays through.
Do not the flowers die every autumn? He had not even
taken root here. I was not startled to hear that he was
dead; it seemed the most natural event that could
happen. His fine organization demanded it, and nature
gently yielded its request. It would have been strange
if he had lived. Neither will nature manifest any sorrow
at his death, but soon the note of the lark will be
heard down in the meadow, and fresh dandelions will
spring from the old stocks where he plucked them last
summer.</p>

<p>I have been living ill of late, but am now doing better.

<p class="center p2">TO MRS. LUCY BROWN (AT PLYMOUTH).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, January 24, 1843.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;The other day I wrote you a letter
to go in Mrs. Emerson's bundle, but, as it seemed unworthy,
I did not send it, and now, to atone for that, I
am going to send this, whether it be worthy or not. I
will not venture upon news, for, as all the household
are gone to bed, I cannot learn what has been told you.
Do you read any noble verses nowadays? or do not
verses still seem noble? For my own part, they have
been the only things I remembered, or that which occasioned
them, when all things else were blurred and
defaced. All things have put on mourning but they;
for the elegy itself is some victorious melody or joy
escaping from the wreck.</p>

<p>It is a relief to read some true book, wherein all are
equally dead,&mdash;equally alive. I think the best parts
of Shakespeare would only be enchanced by the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
thrilling and affecting events. I have found it so. And
so much the more, as they are not intended for consolation.</p>

<p>Do you think of coming to Concord again? I shall
be glad to see you. I should be glad to know that I
could see you when I would.</p>

<p>We always seem to be living just on the brink of a
pure and lofty intercourse, which would make the ills
and trivialness of life ridiculous. After each little interval,
though it be but for the night, we are prepared
to meet each other as gods and goddesses.</p>

<p>I seem to have dodged all my days with one or two
persons, and lived upon expectation,&mdash;as if the bud
would surely blossom; and so I am content to live.</p>

<p>What means the fact&mdash;which is so common, so
universal&mdash;that some soul that has lost all hope for
itself can inspire in another listening soul an infinite
confidence in it, even while it is expressing its despair?</p>

<p>I am very happy in my present environment, though
actually mean enough myself, and so, of course, all
around me; yet, I am sure, we for the most part are
transfigured to one another, and are that to the other
which we aspire to be ourselves. The longest course of
mean and trivial intercourse may not prevent my practicing
this divine courtesy to my companion. Notwithstanding
all I hear about brooms, and scouring, and
taxes, and housekeeping, I am constrained to live a
strangely mixed life,&mdash;as if even Valhalla might have
its kitchen. We are all of us Apollos serving some
Admetus.</p>

<p>I think I must have some Muses in my pay that I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
know not of, for certain musical wishes of mine are
answered as soon as entertained. Last summer I went
to Hawthorne's suddenly for the express purpose of
borrowing his music-box, and almost immediately Mrs.
Hawthorne proposed to lend it to me. The other day I
said I must go to Mrs. Barrett's to hear hers, and lo!
straightway Richard Fuller sent me one for a present
from Cambridge. It is a very good one. I should like
to have you hear it. I shall not have to employ you to
borrow for me now. Good-night.</p>

<p class="left45">
From your affectionate friend,<br />
<span class="i4">H. D. T.</span></p>

<p class="center p2">TO RICHARD F. FULLER (AT CAMBRIDGE).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, January 16, 1843.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Richard</span>,&mdash;I need not thank you for your
present, for I hear its music, which seems to be playing
just for us two pilgrims marching over hill and dale of
a summer afternoon, up those long Bolton hills and by
those bright Harvard lakes, such as I see in the placid
Lucerne on the lid; and whenever I hear it, it will recall
happy hours passed with its donor.</p>

<p>When did mankind make that foray into nature and
bring off this booty? For certainly it is but history that
some rare virtue in remote times plundered these strains
from above and communicated them to men. Whatever
we may think of it, it is a part of the harmony of the
spheres you have sent me; which has condescended to
serve us Admetuses, and I hope I may so behave that
this may always be the tenor of your thought for me.</p>

<p>If you have any strains, the conquest of your own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
spear or quill, to accompany these, let the winds waft
them also to me.</p>

<p>I write this with one of the "primaries" of my
osprey's wings, which I have preserved over my glass
for some state occasion, and now it offers.</p>

<p>Mrs. Emerson sends her love.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO MRS. LUCY BROWN (AT PLYMOUTH).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, Friday evening,
January 25, 1843.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;Mrs. Emerson asks me to write
you a letter, which she will put into her bundle to-morrow
along with the "Tribunes" and "Standards,"
and miscellanies, and what not, to make an assortment.
But what shall I write? You live a good way off, and
I don't know that I have anything which will bear sending
so far. But I am mistaken, or rather impatient
when I say this,&mdash;for we all have a gift to send, not
only when the year begins, but as long as interest and
memory last. I don't know whether you have got the
many I have sent you, or rather whether you were
quite sure where they came from. I mean the letters I
have sometimes launched off eastward in my thought;
but if you have been happier at one time than another,
think that then you received them. But this that I now
send you is of another sort. It will go slowly, drawn
by horses over muddy roads, and lose much of its little
value by the way. You may have to pay for it, and it
may not make you happy after all. But what shall be
my new-year's gift, then? Why, I will send you my
still fresh remembrance of the hours I have passed with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
you here, for I find in the remembrance of them the
best gift you have left to me. We are poor and sick
creatures at best; but we can have well memories, and
sound and healthy thoughts of one another still, and
an intercourse may be remembered which was without
blur, and above us both.</p>

<p>Perhaps you may like to know of my estate nowadays.
As usual, I find it harder to account for the
happiness I enjoy, than for the sadness which instructs
me occasionally. If the little of this last which visits
me would only be sadder, it would be happier. One
while I am vexed by a sense of meanness; one while I
simply wonder at the mystery of life; and at another,
and at another, seem to rest on my oars, as if propelled
by propitious breezes from I know not what quarter.
But for the most part I am an idle, inefficient, lingering
(one term will do as well as another, where all are
true and none true enough) member of the great commonwealth,
who have most need of my own charity,&mdash;if
I could not be charitable and indulgent to myself,
perhaps as good a subject for my own satire as any.
You see how, when I come to talk of myself, I soon
run dry, for I would fain make that a subject which
can be no subject for me, at least not till I have the
grace to rule myself.</p>

<p>I do not venture to say anything about your griefs,
for it would be unnatural for me to speak as if I grieved
with you, when I think I do not. If I were to see you,
it might be otherwise. But I know you will pardon the
trivialness of this letter; and I only hope&mdash;as I know
that you have reason to be so&mdash;that you are still happier
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
than you are sad, and that you remember that the
smallest seed of faith is of more worth than the largest
fruit of happiness. I have no doubt that out of S&mdash;&mdash;'s
death you sometimes draw sweet consolation, not only
for that, but for long-standing griefs, and may find
some things made smooth by it, which before were
rough.</p>

<p>I wish you would communicate with me, and not
think me unworthy to know any of your thoughts.
Don't think me unkind because I have not written to
you. I confess it was for so poor a reason as that you
almost made a principle of not answering. I could not
speak truly with this ugly fact in the way; and perhaps
I wished to be assured, by such evidence as you could
not voluntarily give, that it was a kindness. For every
glance at the moon, does she not send me an answering
ray? Noah would hardly have done himself the pleasure
to release his dove, if she had not been about to
come back to him with tidings of green islands amid
the waste.</p>

<p>But these are far-fetched reasons. I am not speaking
directly enough to yourself now; so let me say <i>directly</i></p>

<p class="left45">From your friend,<br />
<span class="smcap i4">Henry D. Thoreau.</span></p>

<p>Exactly when correspondence began between Emerson
and Thoreau is not now to be ascertained, since all
the letters do not seem to have been preserved. Their
acquaintance opened while Thoreau was in college,
although Emerson may have seen the studious boy at
the town school in Concord, or at the "Academy"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
there, while fitting for college. But they only came to
know each other as sharers of the same thoughts and
aspirations in the autumn of 1837, when, on hearing a
new lecture of Emerson's, Helen Thoreau said to Mrs.
Brown, then living or visiting in the Thoreau family,
"Henry has a thought very like that in his journal"
(which he had newly begun to keep). Mrs. Brown
desired to see the passage, and soon bore it to her sister,
Mrs. Emerson, whose husband saw it, and asked Mrs.
Brown to bring her young friend to see him. By 1838
their new relation of respect was established, and Emerson
wrote to a correspondent, "I delight much in my
young friend, who seems to have as free and erect a
mind as any I have ever met." A year later (Aug. 9,
1839), he wrote to Carlyle, "I have a young poet in
this village, named Thoreau, who writes the truest
verses." Indeed, it was in the years 1839-40 that he
seems to have written the poems by which he is best
remembered. Thoreau told me in his last illness that
he had written many verses and destroyed many,&mdash;this
fact he then regretted, although he had done it at
the instance of Emerson, who did not praise them.
"But," said he, "they may have been better than we
thought them, twenty years ago."</p>

<p>The earliest note which I find from Emerson to
Thoreau bears no date, but must have been written
before 1842, for at no later time could the persons
named in it have visited Concord together. Most likely
it was in the summer of 1840, and to the same date do
I assign a note asking Henry to join the Emersons in a
party to the Cliffs (<i>scopuli Pulchri-Portus</i>), and to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
bring his flute,&mdash;for on that pastoral reed Thoreau
played sweetly. The first series of letters from Thoreau
to Emerson begins early in 1843, about the time the
letters just given were written to Mrs. Brown. In the
first he gives thanks to Emerson for the hospitality of
his house in the two preceding years; a theme to which
he returned a few months later,&mdash;for I doubt not the
lovely sad poem called "The Departure" was written
at Staten Island soon after his leaving the Emerson
house in Concord for the more stately but less congenial
residence of William Emerson at Staten Island,
whither he betook himself in May, 1843. This first
letter, however, was sent from the Concord home to
Waldo Emerson at Staten Island, or perhaps in New
York, where he was that winter giving a course of
lectures.</p>

<p>In explanation of the passages concerning Bronson
Alcott, in this letter, it should be said that he was then
living at the Hosmer Cottage, in Concord, with his
English friends, Charles Lane and Henry Wright, and
that he had refused to pay a tax in support of what he
considered an unjust government, and was arrested by
the constable, Sam Staples, in consequence.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO R. W. EMERSON (AT NEW YORK).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, January 24, 1843.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;The best way to correct a mistake
is to make it right. I had not spoken of writing to you,
but as you say you are about to write to me when you
get my letter, I make haste on my part in order to get
yours the sooner. I don't well know what to say to earn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
the forthcoming epistle, unless that Edith takes rapid
strides in the arts and sciences&mdash;or music and natural
history&mdash;as well as over the carpet; that she says
"papa" less and less abstractedly every day, looking
in <i>my</i> face,&mdash;which may sound like a <i>Ranz des Vaches</i>
to yourself. And Ellen declares every morning that
"papa <i>may</i> come home to-night;" and by and by it will
have changed to such positive statement as that "papa
came home <i>larks</i> night."</p>

<p>Elizabeth Hoar still flits about these clearings, and I
meet her here and there, and in all houses but her own,
but as if I were not the less of her family for all that.
I have made slight acquaintance also with one Mrs.
Lidian Emerson, who almost persuades me to be a
Christian, but I fear I as often lapse into heathenism.
Mr. O'Sullivan<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
 was here three days. I met him at the
Atheneum [Concord], and went to Hawthorne's [at the
Old Manse] to tea with him. He expressed a great deal
of interest in your poems, and wished me to give him
a list of them, which I did; he saying he did not know
but he should notice them. He is a rather puny-looking
man, and did not strike me. We had nothing to
say to one another, and therefore we said a great deal!
He, however, made a point of asking me to write for
his Review, which I shall be glad to do. He is, at any
rate, one of the not-bad, but does not by any means
take you by storm,&mdash;no, nor by calm, which is the best
way. He expects to see you in New York. After tea I
carried him and Hawthorne to the Lyceum.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Alcott has not altered much since you left. I
think you will find him much the same sort of person.
With Mr. Lane I have had one regular chat <i>à la</i> George
Minott, which of course was greatly to our mutual
grati- and edification; and, as two or three as regular
conversations have taken place since, I fear there may
have been a precession of the equinoxes. Mr. Wright,
according to the last accounts, is in Lynn, with uncertain
aims and prospects,&mdash;maturing slowly, perhaps,
as indeed are all of us. I suppose they have told you
how near Mr. Alcott went to the jail, but I can add a
good anecdote to the rest. When Staples came to collect
Mrs. Ward's taxes, my sister Helen asked him
what he thought Mr. Alcott meant,&mdash;what his idea
was,&mdash;and he answered, "I vum, I believe it was
nothing but principle, for I never heerd a man talk
honester."</p>

<p>There was a lecture on Peace by a Mr. Spear (ought
he not to be beaten into a plowshare?), the same evening,
and, as the gentlemen, Lane and Alcott, dined at
our house while the matter was in suspense,&mdash;that is,
while the constable was waiting for his receipt from
the jailer,&mdash;we there settled it that we, that is, Lane
and myself, perhaps, should agitate the State while
Winkelried lay in durance. But when, over the audience,
I saw our hero's head moving in the free air of
the Universalist church, my fire all went out, and the
State was safe as far as I was concerned. But Lane, it
seems, had cogitated and even written on the matter, in
the afternoon, and so, out of courtesy, taking his point
of departure from the Spear-man's lecture, he drove
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
gracefully <i>in medias res</i>, and gave the affair a very good
setting out; but, to spoil all, our martyr very characteristically,
but, as artists would say, in bad taste,
brought up the rear with a "My Prisons," which made
us forget Silvio Pellico himself.</p>

<p>Mr. Lane wishes me to ask you to see if there is
anything for him in the New York office, and pay the
charges. Will you tell me what to do with Mr. [Theodore]
Parker, who was to lecture February 15th? Mrs.
Emerson says my letter is written instead of one from
her.</p>

<p>At the end of this strange letter I will not write&mdash;what
alone I had to say&mdash;to thank you and Mrs.
Emerson for your long kindness to me. It would be
more ungrateful than my constant thought. I have
been your pensioner for nearly two years, and still left
free as under the sky. It has been as free a gift as the
sun or the summer, though I have sometimes molested
you with my mean acceptance of it,&mdash;I who have
failed to render even those slight services of the <i>hand</i>
which would have been for a sign at least; and, by the
fault of my nature, have failed of many better and
higher services. But I will not trouble you with this,
but for once thank you as well as Heaven.</p>

<p class="left45">
Your friend,<span class="i4">H. D. T.</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Lidian Emerson, the wife of R. W. Emerson,
and her two daughters, Ellen and Edith, are named in
this first letter, and will be frequently mentioned in the
correspondence. At this date, Edith, now Mrs. W. H.
Forbes, was fourteen months old. Mr. Emerson's mother,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
Madam Ruth Emerson, was also one of the household,
which had for a little more than seven years
occupied the well-known house under the trees, east of
the village.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO R. W. EMERSON (AT NEW YORK).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, February 10, 1843.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;I have stolen one of your own
sheets to write you a letter upon, and I hope, with two
layers of ink, to turn it into a comforter. If you like
to receive a letter from me, too, I am glad, for it gives
me pleasure to write. But don't let it come amiss; it
must fall as harmlessly as leaves settle on the landscape.
I will tell you what we are doing this now. Supper is
done, and Edith&mdash;the dessert, perhaps more than the
dessert&mdash;is brought in, or even comes in <i>per se</i>; and
round she goes, now to this altar, and then to that,
with her monosyllabic invocation of "oc," "oc." It
makes me think of "Langue d'oc." She must belong
to that province. And like the gypsies she talks a language
of her own while she understands ours. While
she jabbers Sanskrit, Parsee, Pehlvi, say "Edith go
bah!" and "bah" it is. No intelligence passes between
us. She knows. It is a capital joke,&mdash;that is
the reason she smiles so. How well the secret is kept!
she never descends to explanation. It is not buried
liked a common secret, bolstered up on two sides, but
by an eternal silence on the one side, at least. It has
been long kept, and comes in from the unexplored
horizon, like a blue mountain range, to end abruptly at
our door one day. (Don't stumble at this steep simile.)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
And now she studies the heights and depths of nature</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><p>On shoulders whirled in some eccentric orbit</p>
<p>Just by old Pæstum's temples and the perch</p>
<p>Where Time doth plume his wings.</p></div></div>

<p>And now she runs the race over the carpet, while all
Olympia applauds,&mdash;mamma, grandma, and uncle,
good Grecians all,&mdash;and that dark-hued barbarian,
Partheanna Parker, whose shafts go through and
through, not backward! Grandmamma smiles over
all, and mamma is wondering what papa would say,
should she descend on Carlton House some day. "Larks
night" 's abed, dreaming of "pleased faces" far away.
But now the trumpet sounds, the games are over; some
Hebe comes, and Edith is translated. I don't know
where; it must be to some cloud, for I never was
there.</p>

<p><i>Query</i>: what becomes of the answers Edith thinks,
but cannot express? She really gives you glances which
are before this world was. You can't feel any difference
of age, except that you have longer legs and
arms.</p>

<p>Mrs. Emerson said I must tell you about domestic
affairs, when I mentioned that I was going to write.
Perhaps it will inform you of the state of all if I only
say that I am well and happy in your house here in
Concord.</p>

<p class="left45">Your friend,<br />
<span class="smcap i4">Henry.</span></p>

<p>Don't forget to tell us what to do with Mr. Parker
when you write next. I lectured this week. It was as
bright a night as you could wish. I hope there were
no stars thrown away on the occasion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span></p>

<p>[A part of the same letter, though bearing a date two
days later, and written in a wholly different style, as
from one sage to another, is this postscript:]</p>

<p class="address">
February 12, 1843.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;As the packet still tarries, I will
send you some thoughts, which I have lately relearned,
as the latest public and private news.</p>

<p>How mean are our relations to one another! Let us
pause till they are nobler. A little silence, a little rest,
is good. It would be sufficient employment only to cultivate
true ones.</p>

<p>The richest gifts we can bestow are the least marketable.
We hate the kindness which we understand. A
noble person confers no such gift as his whole confidence:
none so exalts the giver and the receiver; it
produces the truest gratitude. Perhaps it is only essential
to friendship that some vital trust should have been
reposed by the one in the other. I feel addressed and
probed even to the remote parts of my being when one
nobly shows, even in trivial things, an implicit faith in
me. When such divine commodities are so near and
cheap, how strange that it should have to be each day's
discovery! A threat or a curse may be forgotten, but this
mild trust translates me. I am no more of this earth;
it acts dynamically; it changes my very substance. I
cannot do what before I did. I cannot be what before
I was. Other chains may be broken, but in the darkest
night, in the remotest place, I trail this thread. Then
things cannot <i>happen</i>. What if God were to confide in
us for a moment! Should we not then be gods?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span></p>

<p>How subtle a thing is this confidence! Nothing sensible
passes between; never any consequences are to be
apprehended should it be misplaced. Yet something
has transpired. A new behavior springs; the ship carries
new ballast in her hold. A sufficiently great and
generous trust could never be abused. It should be cause
to lay down one's life,&mdash;which would not be to lose it.
Can there be any mistake up there? Don't the gods
know where to invest their wealth? Such confidence,
too, would be reciprocal. When one confides greatly in
you, he will feel the roots of an equal trust fastening
themselves in him. When such trust has been received
or reposed, we dare not speak, hardly to see each other;
our voices sound harsh and untrustworthy. We are as
instruments which the Powers have dealt with. Through
what straits would we not carry this little burden of a
magnanimous trust! Yet no harm could possibly come,
but simply faithlessness. Not a feather, not a straw, is
intrusted; that packet is empty. It is only <i>committed</i> to
us, and, as it were, all things are committed to us.</p>

<p>The kindness I have longest remembered has been of
this sort,&mdash;the sort unsaid; so far behind the speaker's
lips that almost it already lay in my heart. It did not
have far to go to be communicated. The gods cannot
misunderstand, man cannot explain. We communicate
like the burrows of foxes, in silence and darkness, under
ground. We are undermined by faith and love. How
much more full is Nature where we think the empty
space is than where we place the solids!&mdash;full of fluid
influences. Should we ever communicate but by these?
The spirit abhors a vacuum more than Nature. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
is a tide which pierces the pores of the air. These aerial
rivers, let us not pollute their currents. What meadows
do they course through? How many fine mails there
are which traverse their routes! He is privileged who
gets his letter franked by them.</p>

<p>I believe these things.</p>

<p class="left45">
<span class="smcap">Henry D. Thoreau.</span></p>

<p>Emerson replied to these letters in two epistles of
dates from February 4 to 12, 1843,&mdash;in the latter asking
Thoreau to aid him in editing the April number of the
<i>Dial</i> of which he had taken charge. Among other
things, Emerson desired a manuscript of Charles Lane,
Alcott's English friend, to be sent to him in New York,
where he was detained several weeks by his lectures.
He added: "Have we no news from Wheeler? Has
Bartlett none?" Of these persons, the first, Charles
Stearns Wheeler, a college classmate of Thoreau, and
later Greek tutor in the college, had gone to Germany,&mdash;where
he died the next summer,&mdash;and was contributing
to the quarterly <i>Dial</i>. Robert Bartlett, of
Plymouth, a townsman of Mrs. Emerson, was Wheeler's
intimate friend, with whom he corresponded.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
 To this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
editorial request Thoreau, who was punctuality itself,
replied at once.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO R. W. EMERSON (AT NEW YORK).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, February 15, 1843.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,&mdash;I got your letters, one yesterday
and the other to-day, and they have made me quite
happy. As a packet is to go in the morning, I will
give you a hasty account of the <i>Dial</i>. I called on Mr.
Lane this afternoon, and brought away, together with
an abundance of good-will, first, a bulky catalogue of
books without commentary,&mdash;some eight hundred, I
think he told me, with an introduction filling one sheet,&mdash;ten
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
or a dozen pages, say, though I have only glanced
at them; second, a review&mdash;twenty-five or thirty printed
pages&mdash;of Conversations on the Gospels, Record of a
School, and Spiritual Culture, with rather copious extracts.
However, it is a good subject, and Lane says it
gives him satisfaction. I will give it a faithful reading
directly. [These were Alcott's publications, reviewed
by Lane.] And now I come to the little end of the
horn; for myself, I have brought along the Minor
Greek Poets, and will mine there for a scrap or two, at
least. As for Etzler, I don't remember any "rude and
snappish speech" that you made, and if you did it must
have been longer than anything I had written; however,
here is the book still, and I will try. Perhaps I have
some few scraps in my Journal which you may choose
to print. The translation of the Æschylus I should like
very well to continue anon, if it should be worth the
while. As for poetry, I have not remembered to write
any for some time; it has quite slipped my mind; but
sometimes I think I hear the mutterings of the thunder.
Don't you remember that last summer we heard a low,
tremulous sound in the woods and over the hills, and
thought it was partridges or rocks, and it proved to be
thunder gone down the river? But sometimes it was
over Wayland way, and at last burst over our heads.
So we'll not despair by reason of the drought. You see
it takes a good many words to supply the place of one
deed; a hundred lines to a cobweb, and but one cable
to a man-of-war. The <i>Dial</i> case needs to be reformed
in many particulars. There is no news from Wheeler,
none from Bartlett.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<p>They all look well and happy in this house, where it
gives me much pleasure to dwell.</p>

<p class="left45">
Yours in haste, <span class="smcap i4">Henry</span>.</p>

<p>P. S.</p>

<p class="address">
Wednesday evening, February 16.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;I have time to write a few words
about the <i>Dial</i>. I have just received the three first
signatures, which do not yet complete Lane's piece. He
will place five hundred copies for sale at Munroe's
bookstore. Wheeler has sent you two full sheets&mdash;more
about the German universities&mdash;and proper
names, which will have to be printed in alphabetical
order for convenience; what this one has done, that
one is doing, and the other intends to do. Hammer-Purgstall
(Von Hammer) may be one, for aught I know.
However, there are two or three <i>things</i> in it, as well as
names. One of the books of Herodotus is discovered to
be out of place. He says something about having sent
Lowell, by the last steamer, a budget of literary news,
which he will have communicated to you ere this. Mr.
Alcott has a letter from Heraud,<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
 and a book written
by him,&mdash;the Life of Savonarola,&mdash;which he wishes
to have republished here. Mr. Lane will write a notice
of it. (The latter says that what is in the New York
post-office <i>may</i> be directed to Mr. Alcott.) Miss [Elizabeth]
Peabody has sent a "Notice to the readers of the
<i>Dial</i>" which is not good.</p>

<p>Mr. Chapin lectured this evening, and so rhetorically
that I forgot my duty and heard very little. I find myself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
better than I have been, and am meditating some
other method of paying debts than by lectures and
writing,&mdash;which will only do to talk about. If anything
of that "other" sort should come to your ears in
New York, will you remember it for me?</p>

<p>Excuse this scrawl, which I have written over the
embers in the dining-room. I hope that you live on
good terms with yourself and the gods.</p>

<p class="left25">
Yours in haste,
<span class="smcap i4">Henry</span>.</p>

<p>Mr. Lane and his lucubrations proved to be tough
subjects, and the next letter has more to say about
them and the <i>Dial</i>. Lane had undertaken to do justice
to Mr. Alcott and his books, as may still be read in the
pages of that April number of the Transcendentalist
quarterly.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO R. W. EMERSON (AT NEW YORK).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, February 20, 1843.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,&mdash;I have read Mr. Lane's review,
and <i>can</i> say, speaking for this world and for fallen man,
that "it is good for us." As they say in geology, time
never fails, there is always enough of it, so I may say,
criticism never fails; but if I go and read elsewhere, I
say it is good,&mdash;far better than any notice Mr. Alcott
has received, or is likely to receive from another
quarter. It is at any rate "the other side" which
Boston needs to hear. I do not send it to you, because
time is precious, and because I think you would accept
it, after all. After speaking briefly of the fate of Goethe
and Carlyle in their own countries, he says, "To
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
Emerson in his own circle is but slowly accorded a
worthy response; and Alcott, almost utterly neglected,"
etc. I will strike out what relates to yourself, and correcting
some verbal faults, send the rest to the printer
with Lane's initials.</p>

<p>The catalogue needs amendment, I think. It wants
completeness now. It should consist of such books only
as they would tell Mr. [F. H.] Hedge and [Theodore]
Parker they had got; omitting the Bible, the classics,
and much besides,&mdash;for there the incompleteness begins.
But you will be here in season for this.</p>

<p>It is frequently easy to make Mr. Lane more universal
and attractive; to write, for instance, "universal
ends" instead of "the universal end," just as we pull
open the petals of a flower with our fingers where they
are confined by its own sweets. Also he had better not
say "books designed for the nucleus of a <i>Home</i> University,"
until he makes that word "home" ring solid and
universal too. This is that abominable dialect. He had
just given me a notice of George Bradford's Fénelon
for the Record of the Months, and speaks of extras of
the Review and Catalogue, if they are printed,&mdash;even
a hundred, or thereabouts. How shall this be arranged?
Also he wishes to use some manuscripts of his which
are in your possession, if you do not. Can I get them?</p>

<p>I think of no news to tell you. It is a serene summer
day here, all above the snow. The hens steal their
nests, and I steal their eggs still, as formerly. This is
what I do with the hands. Ah, labor,&mdash;it is a divine
institution, and conversation with many men and hens.</p>

<p>Do not think that my letters require as many special
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
answers. I get one as often as you write to Concord.
Concord inquires for you daily, as do all the members
of this house. You must make haste home before we
have settled all the great questions, for they are fast
being disposed of. But I must leave room for Mrs.
Emerson.</p>

<p class="p2">Mrs. Emerson's letter, after speaking of other matters,
gave a lively sketch of Thoreau at one of Alcott's
Conversations in her house, which may be quoted as
illustrating the young Nature-worshiper's position at
the time, and the more humane and socialistic spirit of
Alcott and Lane, who were soon to leave Concord for
their experiment of communistic life at "Fruitlands,"
in the rural town of Harvard.</p>

<p>"Last evening we had the 'Conversation,' though,
owing to the bad weather, but few attended. The subjects
were: What is Prophecy? Who is a Prophet? and
The Love of Nature. Mr. Lane decided, as for all
time and the race, that this same love of nature&mdash;of
which Henry [Thoreau] was the champion, and Elizabeth
Hoar and Lidian (though L. disclaimed possessing
it herself) his faithful squiresses&mdash;that this love
was the most subtle and dangerous of sins; a refined
idolatry, much more to be dreaded than gross wickednesses,
because the gross sinner would be alarmed by
the depth of his degradation, and come up from it in
terror, but the unhappy idolaters of Nature were deceived
by the refined quality of their sin, and would be
the last to enter the kingdom. Henry frankly affirmed
to both the wise men that they were wholly deficient in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
the faculty in question, and therefore could not judge
of it. And Mr. Alcott as frankly answered that it was
because they went beyond the mere material objects,
and were filled with spiritual love and perception (as
Mr. T. was not), that they seemed to Mr. Thoreau not
to appreciate outward nature. I am very heavy, and
have spoiled a most excellent story. I have given you
no idea of the scene, which was ineffably comic, though
it made no laugh at the time; I scarcely laughed at it
myself,&mdash;too deeply amused to give the usual sign.
Henry was brave and noble; well as I have always
liked him, he still grows upon me."</p>

<p>Before going to Staten Island in May, 1843, Thoreau
answered a letter from the same Richard Fuller who
had made him the musical gift in the previous winter.
He was at Harvard College, and desired to know something
of Thoreau's pursuits there,&mdash;concerning which
Channing says in his Life,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
 "He was a respectable
student, having done there a bold reading in English
poetry,&mdash;even to some portions or the whole of Davenant's
'Gondibert.'" This, Thoreau does not mention
in his letter, but it was one of the things that attracted
Emerson's notice, since he also had the same taste for
the Elizabethan and Jacobean English poets. An English
youth, Henry Headley, pupil of Dr. Parr, and
graduate of Oxford in 1786, had preceded Thoreau in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
this study of poets that had become obsolete; and it
was perhaps Headley's volume, "Select Beauties of
Ancient English Poetry, with Remarks by the late
Henry Headley," published long after his death,<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
 that
served Thoreau as a guide to Quarles and the Fletchers,
Daniel, Drummond, Drayton, Habington, and
Raleigh,&mdash;poets that few Americans had heard of in
1833.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO RICHARD F. FULLER (AT CAMBRIDGE).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, April 2, 1843.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Richard</span>,&mdash;I was glad to receive a letter
from you so bright and cheery. You speak of not having
made any conquests with your own spear or quill
as yet; but if you are tempering your spear-head during
these days, and fitting a straight and tough shaft thereto,
will not that suffice? We are more pleased to consider
the hero in the forest cutting cornel or ash for his spear,
than marching in triumph with his trophies. The present
hour is always wealthiest when it is poorer than
the future ones, as that is the pleasantest site which
affords the pleasantest prospects.</p>

<p>What you say about your studies furnishing you with
a "mimic idiom" only, reminds me that we shall all
do well if we learn so much as to talk,&mdash;to speak truth.
The only fruit which even much living yields seems to
be often only some trivial success,&mdash;the ability to do
some slight thing better. We make conquest only of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
husks and shells for the most part,&mdash;at least apparently,&mdash;but
sometimes these are cinnamon and spices,
you know. Even the grown hunter you speak of slays
a thousand buffaloes, and brings off only their hides
and tongues. What immense sacrifices, what hecatombs
and holocausts, the gods exact for very slight
favors! How much sincere life before we can even
utter one sincere word.</p>

<p>What I was learning in college was chiefly, I think,
to express myself, and I see now, that as the old orator
prescribed, 1st, action; 2d, action; 3d, action; my
teachers should have prescribed to me, 1st, sincerity;
2d, sincerity; 3d, sincerity. The old mythology is incomplete
without a god or goddess of sincerity, on whose
altars we might offer up all the products of our farms,
our workshops, and our studies. It should be our Lar
when we sit on the hearth, and our Tutelar Genius
when we walk abroad. This is the only panacea. I
mean sincerity in our dealings with ourselves mainly;
any other is comparatively easy. But I must stop before
I get to 17thly. I believe I have but one text and one
sermon.</p>

<p>Your rural adventures beyond the West Cambridge
hills have probably lost nothing by distance of time or
space. I used to hear only the sough of the wind in
the woods of Concord, when I was striving to give my
attention to a page of calculus. But, depend upon it,
you will love your native hills the better for being separated
from them.</p>

<p>I expect to leave Concord, which is my Rome, and
its people, who are my Romans, in May, and go to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
New York, to be a tutor in Mr. William Emerson's
family. So I will bid you good-by till I see you or hear
from you again.</p>

<p class="p2">Going to Staten Island, early in May, 1843, Thoreau's
first care was to write to his "Romans, countrymen,
and lovers by the banks of the Musketaquid,"&mdash;beginning
with his mother, his sisters, and Mrs. Emerson.
To Sophia and Mrs. E. he wrote May 22,&mdash;to Helen,
with a few touching verses on his brother John, the next
day; and then he resumed the correspondence with
Emerson. It seems that one of his errands near New
York was to make the acquaintance of literary men and
journalists in the city, in order to find a vehicle for
publication, such as his neighbor Hawthorne had finally
found in the pages of the <i>Democratic Review</i>. For
this purpose Thoreau made himself known to Henry
James, and other friends of Emerson, and to Horace
Greeley, then in the first freshness of his success with
the <i>Tribune</i>,&mdash;a newspaper hardly more than two
years old then, but destined to a great career, in which
several of the early Transcendentalists took some part.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO HIS FATHER AND MOTHER (AT CONCORD).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Castleton, Staten Island</span>, May 11, 1843.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mother and Friends at Home</span>,&mdash;We arrived
here safely at ten o'clock on Sunday morning, having
had as good a passage as usual, though we ran aground
and were detained a couple of hours in the Thames River,
till the tide came to our relief. At length we curtseyed
up to a wharf just the other side of their Castle Garden,&mdash;very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
incurious about them and their city. I believe
my vacant looks, absolutely inaccessible to questions,
did at length satisfy an army of starving cabmen that I
did not want a hack, cab, or anything of that sort as
yet. It was the only demand the city made on us; as
if a wheeled vehicle of some sort were the sum and
summit of a reasonable man's wants. "Having tried
the water," they seemed to say, "will you not return to
the pleasant securities of land carriage? Else why your
boat's prow turned toward the shore at last?" They
are a sad-looking set of fellows, not permitted to come
on board, and I pitied them. They had been expecting
me, it would seem, and did really wish that I should
take a cab; though they did not seem rich enough to
supply me with one.</p>

<p>It was a confused jumble of heads and soiled coats,
dangling from flesh-colored faces,&mdash;all swaying to and
fro, as by a sort of undertow, while each whipstick, true
as the needle to the pole, still preserved that level and
direction in which its proprietor had dismissed his forlorn
interrogatory. They took sight from them,&mdash;the
lash being wound up thereon, to prevent your attention
from wandering, or to make it concentre upon its object
by the spiral line. They began at first, perhaps,
with the modest, but rather confident inquiry, "Want
a cab, sir?" but as their despair increased, it took the
affirmative tone, as the disheartened and irresolute are
apt to do: "You want a cab, sir," or even, "You want
a nice cab, sir, to take you to Fourth Street." The
question which one had bravely and hopefully begun to
put, another had the tact to take up and conclude with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
fresh emphasis,&mdash;twirling it from his particular whipstick
as if it had emanated from his lips,&mdash;as the sentiment
did from his heart. Each one could truly say,
"Them 's my sentiments." But it was a sad sight.</p>

<p>I am seven and a half miles from New York, and, as
it would take half a day at least, have not been there
yet. I have already run over no small part of the island,
to the highest hill, and some way along the shore. From
the hill directly behind the house I can see New York,
Brooklyn, Long Island, the Narrows, through which
vessels bound to and from all parts of the world chiefly
pass,&mdash;Sandy Hook and the Highlands of Neversink
(part of the coast of New Jersey),&mdash;and, by going still
farther up the hill, the Kill van Kull, and Newark Bay.
From the pinnacle of one Madame Grimes's house, the
other night at sunset, I could see almost round the
island. Far in the horizon there was a fleet of sloops
bound up the Hudson, which seemed to be going over
the edge of the earth; and in view of these trading ships
commerce seems quite imposing.</p>

<p>But it is rather derogatory that your dwelling-place
should be only a neighborhood to a great city,&mdash;to live
on an inclined plane. I do not like their cities and forts,
with their morning and evening guns, and sails flapping
in one's eye. I want a whole continent to breathe in, and
a good deal of solitude and silence, such as all Wall
Street cannot buy,&mdash;nor Broadway with its wooden
pavement. I must live along the beach, on the southern
shore, which looks directly out to sea,&mdash;and see
what that great parade of water means, that dashes and
roars, and has not yet wet me, as long as I have lived.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span></p>

<p>I must not know anything about my condition and
relations here till what is not permanent is worn off. I
have not yet subsided. Give me time enough, and I
may like it. All my inner man heretofore has been a
Concord impression; and here come these Sandy Hook
and Coney Island breakers to meet and modify the
former; but it will be long before I can make nature
look as innocently grand and inspiring as in Concord.</p>

<p class="left45">
Your affectionate son,<br />
<span class="smcap i4">Henry D. Thoreau.</span></p>

<p class="center p2">TO SOPHIA THOREAU (AT CONCORD).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Castleton, Staten Island</span>, May 22, 1843.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sophia</span>,&mdash;I have had a severe cold ever since
I came here, and have been confined to the house for
the last week with bronchitis, though I am now getting
out, so I have not seen much in the botanical way. The
cedar seems to be one of the most common trees here,
and the fields are very fragrant with it. There are also
the gum and tulip trees. The latter is not very common,
but is very large and beautiful, having flowers as large
as tulips, and as handsome. It is not time for it yet.</p>

<p>The woods are now full of a large honeysuckle in full
bloom, which differs from ours in being red instead of
white, so that at first I did not know its genus. The
painted-cup is very common in the meadows here.
Peaches, and especially cherries, seem to grow by all
the fences. Things are very forward here compared
with Concord. The apricots growing out-of-doors are
already as large as plums. The apple, pear, peach,
cherry, and plum trees have shed their blossoms. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
whole island is like a garden, and affords very fine
scenery.</p>

<p>In front of the house is a very extensive wood, beyond
which is the sea, whose roar I can hear all night long,
when there is a wind; if easterly winds have prevailed
on the Atlantic. There are always some vessels in sight,&mdash;ten,
twenty, or thirty miles off,&mdash;and Sunday before
last there were hundreds in long procession, stretching
from New York to Sandy Hook, and far beyond, for
Sunday is a lucky day.</p>

<p>I went to New York Saturday before last. A walk
of half an hour, by half a dozen houses, along the Richmond
road&mdash;that is the road that leads to Richmond,
on which we live&mdash;brings me to the village of Stapleton,
in Southfield, where is the lower dock; but if I
prefer I can walk along the shore three quarters of a
mile farther toward New York to the quarantine village
of Castleton, to the upper dock, which the boat
leaves five or six times every day, a quarter of an hour
later than the former place. Farther on is the village
of New Brighton, and farther still Port Richmond,
which villages another steamboat visits.</p>

<p>In New York I saw George Ward, and also Giles
Waldo and William Tappan, whom I can describe
better when I have seen them more. They are young
friends of Mr. Emerson. Waldo came down to the
island to see me the next day. I also saw the Great
Western, the Croton water-works, and the picture-gallery
of the National Academy of Design. But I have
not had time to see or do much yet.</p>

<p>Tell Miss Ward I shall try to put my microscope to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
good use, and if I find any new and preservable flower,
will throw it into my commonplace-book. Garlic, the
original of the common onion, grows here all over the
fields, and during its season spoils the cream and butter
for the market, as the cows like it very much.</p>

<p>Tell Helen there are two schools of late established
in the neighborhood, with large prospects, or rather
designs, one for boys and another for girls. The latter
by a Miss Errington, and though it is only small as
yet, I will keep my ears open for her in such directions.
The encouragement is very slight.</p>

<p>I hope you will not be washed away by the Irish sea.</p>

<p>Tell Mother I think my cold was not wholly owing
to imprudence. Perhaps I was being acclimated.</p>

<p>Tell Father that Mr. Tappan, whose son I know,&mdash;and
whose clerks young Tappan and Waldo are,&mdash;has
invented and established a new and very important
business, which Waldo thinks would allow them to
burn ninety-nine out of one hundred of the stores in
New York, which now only offset and cancel one another.
It is a kind of intelligence office for the whole
country, with branches in the principal cities, giving
information with regard to the credit and affairs of
every man of business of the country. Of course it is
not popular at the South and West. It is an extensive
business and will employ a great many clerks.</p>

<p>Love to all&mdash;not forgetting Aunt and Aunts&mdash;and
Miss and Mrs. Ward.</p>

<p>As the first letter of Thoreau to Emerson was to
thank him for his lofty friendship, so now the first letter
to Mrs. Emerson, after leaving her house, was to
say similar things, with a passing allusion to her love
of flowers and of gardening, in which she surpassed all
his acquaintance in Concord, then and afterward. A
letter to Emerson followed, touching on the <i>Dial</i> and
on several of his new and old acquaintance. "Rockwood
Hoar" is the person since known as judge and
cabinet officer,&mdash;the brother of Senator Hoar, and of
Thoreau's special friends Elizabeth and Edward Hoar.
Channing is the poet, who had lately printed his first
volume, without finding many readers.

<p class="center p2">TO MRS. EMERSON (AT CONCORD).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Castleton, Staten Island</span>, May 22, 1843.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;I believe a good many conversations
with you were left in an unfinished state,
and now indeed I don't know where to take them up.
But I will resume some of the unfinished silence. I
shall not hesitate to know you. I think of you as some
elder sister of mine, whom I could not have avoided,&mdash;a
sort of lunar influence,&mdash;only of such age as the
moon, whose time is measured by her light. You must
know that you represent to me woman, for I have not
traveled very far or wide,&mdash;and what if I had? I like
to deal with you, for I believe you do not lie or steal,
and these are very rare virtues. I thank you for your
influence for two years. I was fortunate to be subjected
to it, and am now to remember it. It is the noblest
gift we can make; what signify all others that can be
bestowed? You have helped to keep my life "on loft,"
as Chaucer says of Griselda, and in a better sense. You
always seemed to look down at me as from some elevation,&mdash;some
of your high humilities,&mdash;and I was the
better for having to look up. I felt taxed not to disappoint
your expectation; for could there be any accident
so sad as to be respected for something better than we
are? It was a pleasure even to go away from you, as it
is not to meet some, as it apprised me of my high relations;
and such a departure is a sort of further introduction
and meeting. Nothing makes the earth seem
so spacious as to have friends at a distance; they make
the latitudes and longitudes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span></p>

<p>You must not think that fate is so dark there, for
even here I can see a faint reflected light over Concord,
and I think that at this distance I can better
weigh the value of a doubt there. Your moonlight, as
I have told you, though it is a reflection of the sun,
allows of bats and owls and other twilight birds to flit
therein. But I am very glad that you can elevate your
life with a doubt, for I am sure that it is nothing but
an insatiable faith after all that deepens and darkens
its current. And your doubt and my confidence are only
a difference of expression.</p>

<p>I have hardly begun to live on Staten Island yet; but,
like the man who, when forbidden to tread on English
ground, carried Scottish ground in his boots, I carry
Concord ground in my boots and in my hat,&mdash;and am
I not made of Concord dust? I cannot realize that it
is the roar of the sea I hear now, and not the wind in
Walden woods. I find more of Concord, after all, in
the prospect of the sea, beyond Sandy Hook, than in
the fields and woods.</p>

<p>If you were to have this Hugh the gardener for your
man, you would think a new dispensation had commenced.
He might put a fairer aspect on the natural
world for you, or at any rate a screen between you and
the almshouse. There is a beautiful red honeysuckle
now in blossom in the woods here, which should be
transplanted to Concord; and if what they tell me
about the tulip tree be true, you should have that also.
I have not seen Mrs. Black yet, but I intend to call on
her soon. Have you established those simpler modes of
living yet?&mdash;"In the full tide of successful operation?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>

<p>Tell Mrs. Brown that I hope she is anchored in a
secure haven and derives much pleasure still from reading
the poets, and that her constellation is not quite set
from my sight, though it is sunk so low in that northern
horizon. Tell Elizabeth Hoar that her bright present
did "carry ink safely to Staten Island," and was
a conspicuous object in Master Haven's inventory of
my effects. Give my respects to Madam Emerson,
whose Concord face I should be glad to see here this
summer; and remember me to the rest of the household
who have had vision of me. Shake a day-day to
Edith, and say good-night to Ellen for me. Farewell.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO R. W. EMERSON (AT CONCORD).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Castleton, Staten Island</span>, May 23.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;I was just going to write to
you when I received your letter. I was waiting till I
had got away from Concord. I should have sent you
something for the <i>Dial</i> before, but I have been sick
ever since I came here, rather unaccountably,&mdash;what
with a cold, bronchitis, acclimation, etc., still unaccountably.
I send you some verses from my Journal
which will help make a packet. I have not time to
correct them, if this goes by Rockwood Hoar. If I can
finish an account of a winter's walk in Concord, in the
midst of a Staten Island summer,&mdash;not so wise as true,
I trust,&mdash;I will send it to you soon.</p>

<p>I have had no later experiences yet. You must not
count much upon what I can do or learn in New York.
I feel a good way off here; and it is not to be visited,
but seen and dwelt in. I have been there but once, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
have been confined to the house since. Everything
there disappoints me but the crowd; rather, I was disappointed
with the rest before I came. I have no eyes
for their churches, and what else they find to brag of.
Though I know but little about Boston, yet what attracts
me, in a quiet way, seems much meaner and
more pretending than there,&mdash;libraries, pictures, and
faces in the street. You don't know where any respectability
inhabits. It is in the crowd in Chatham Street.
The crowd is something new, and to be attended to.
It is worth a thousand Trinity Churches and Exchanges
while it is looking at them, and will run over them and
trample them under foot one day. There are two
things I hear and am aware I live in the neighborhood
of,&mdash;the roar of the sea and the hum of the city. I
have just come from the beach (to find your letter),
and I like it much. Everything there is on a grand
and generous scale,&mdash;seaweed, water, and sand; and
even the dead fishes, horses, and hogs have a rank,
luxuriant odor; great shad-nets spread to dry; crabs
and horseshoes crawling over the sand; clumsy boats,
only for service, dancing like sea-fowl over the surf,
and ships afar off going about their business.</p>

<p>Waldo and Tappan carried me to their English alehouse
the first Saturday, and Waldo spent two hours
here the next day. But Tappan I have only seen. I
like his looks and the sound of his silence. They are
confined every day but Sunday, and then Tappan is
obliged to observe the demeanor of a church-goer to
prevent open war with his father.</p>

<p>I am glad that Channing has got settled, and that,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
too, before the inroad of the Irish. I have read his
poems two or three times over, and partially through
and under, with new and increased interest and appreciation.
Tell him I saw a man buy a copy at Little &amp;
Brown's. He may have been a virtuoso, but we will
give him the credit. What with Alcott and Lane and
Hawthorne, too, you look strong enough to take New
York by storm. Will you tell L., if he asks, that I
have been able to do nothing about the books yet?</p>

<p>Believe that I have something better to write you
than this. It would be unkind to thank you for particular
deeds.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO R. W. EMERSON (AT CONCORD).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Staten Island</span>, June 8, 1843.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;I have been to see Henry James,
and like him very much. It was a great pleasure to
meet him. It makes humanity seem more erect and
respectable. I never was more kindly and faithfully
catechised. It made me respect myself more to be
thought worthy of such wise questions. He is a man,
and takes his own way, or stands still in his own place.
I know of no one so patient and determined to have
the good of you. It is almost friendship, such plain
and human dealing. I think that he will not write or
speak inspiringly; but he is a refreshing, forward-looking
and forward-moving man, and he has naturalized
and humanized New York for me. He actually reproaches
you by his respect for your poor words. I
had three hours' solid talk with him, and he asks me
to make free use of his house. He wants an expression
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
of your faith, or to be sure that it is faith, and confesses
that his own treads fast upon the neck of his
understanding. He exclaimed, at some careless answer
of mine: "Well, you Transcendentalists are wonderfully
consistent. I must get hold of this somehow!"
He likes Carlyle's book,<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
 but says that it leaves him
in an excited and unprofitable state, and that Carlyle is
so ready to obey his humor that he makes the least
vestige of truth the foundation of any superstructure,
not keeping faith with his better genius nor truest
readers.</p>

<p>I met Wright on the stairs of the Society Library,
and W. H. Channing and Brisbane on the steps. The
former (Channing) is a concave man, and you see by
his attitude and the lines of his face that he is retreating
from himself and from yourself, with sad doubts.
It is like a fair mask swaying from the drooping boughs
of some tree whose stem is not seen. He would break
with a conchoidal fracture. You feel as if you would
like to see him when he has made up his mind to run
all the risks. To be sure, he doubts because he has a
great hope to be disappointed, but he makes the possible
disappointment of too much consequence. Brisbane,
with whom I did not converse, did not impress
me favorably. He looks like a man who has lived in a
cellar, far gone in consumption. I barely saw him, but
he did not look as if he could let Fourier go, in any
case, and throw up his hat. But I need not have come
to New York to write this.</p>

<p>I have seen Tappan for two or three hours, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
like both him and Waldo; but I always see those of
whom I have heard well with a slight disappointment.
They are so much better than the great herd, and yet
the heavens are not shivered into diamonds over their
heads. Persons and things flit so rapidly through my
brain nowadays that I can hardly remember them.
They seem to be lying in the stream, stemming the tide,
ready to go to sea, as steamboats when they leave the
dock go off in the opposite direction first, until they are
headed right, and then begins the steady revolution of
the paddle-wheels; and <i>they</i> are not quite cheerily
headed anywhither yet, nor singing amid the shrouds
as they bound over the billows. There is a certain
youthfulness and generosity about them, very attractive;
and Tappan's more reserved and solitary thought
commands respect.</p>

<p>After some ado, I discovered the residence of Mrs.
Black, but there was palmed off on me, in her stead, a
Mrs. Grey (quite an inferior color), who told me at
last that she was not Mrs. Black, but her mother, and
was just as glad to see me as Mrs. Black would have
been, and so, forsooth, would answer just as well. Mrs.
Black had gone with Edward Palmer to New Jersey,
and would return on the morrow.</p>

<p>I don't like the city better, the more I see it, but
worse. I am ashamed of my eyes that behold it. It is
a thousand times meaner than I could have imagined.
It will be something to hate,&mdash;that's the advantage it
will be to me; and even the best people in it are a part
of it, and talk coolly about it. The pigs in the street are
the most respectable part of the population. When will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
the world learn that a million men are of no importance
compared with <i>one</i> man? But I must wait for a shower
of shillings, or at least a slight dew or mizzling of sixpences,
before I explore New York very far.</p>

<p>The sea-beach is the best thing I have seen. It is
very solitary and remote, and you only remember New
York occasionally. The distances, too, along the shore,
and inland in sight of it, are unaccountably great and
startling. The sea seems very near from the hills, but
it proves a long way over the plain, and yet you may
be wet with the spray before you can believe that you
are there. The far seems near, and the near far. Many
rods from the beach, I step aside for the Atlantic, and
I see men drag up their boats on to the sand, with oxen,
stepping about amid the surf, as if it were possible they
might draw up Sandy Hook.</p>

<p>I do not feel myself especially serviceable to the good
people with whom I live, except as inflictions are sanctified
to the righteous. And so, too, must I serve the
boy. I can look to the Latin and mathematics sharply,
and for the rest behave myself. But I cannot be in his
neighborhood hereafter as his Educator, of course, but
as the hawks fly over my own head. I am not attracted
toward him but as to youth generally. He shall frequent
me, however, as much as he can, and I'll be I.</p>

<p>Bradbury<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
 told me, when I passed through Boston,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
that he was coming to New York the following Saturday,
and would then settle with me, but he has not
made his appearance yet. Will you, the next time you
go to Boston, present that order for me which I left
with you?</p>

<p>If I say less about Waldo and Tappan now, it is,
perhaps, because I may have more to say by and by.
Remember me to your mother and Mrs. Emerson, who,
I hope, is quite well. I shall be very glad to hear from
her, as well as from you. I have very hastily written
out something for the <i>Dial</i>, and send it only because
you are expecting something,&mdash;though something better.
It seems idle and Howittish, but it may be of more
worth in Concord, where it belongs. In great haste.
Farewell.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO HIS FATHER AND MOTHER (AT CONCORD).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Castleton</span>, June 8, 1843.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Parents</span>,&mdash;I have got quite well now, and
like the lay of the land and the look of the sea very
much,&mdash;only the country is so fair that it seems rather
too much as if it were made to be looked at. I have
been to New York four or five times, and have run
about the island a good deal.</p>

<p>George Ward, when I last saw him, which was at
his house in Brooklyn, was studying the daguerreotype
process, preparing to set up in that line. The boats run
now almost every hour from 8 <span class="smcap">A. M.</span> to 7 <span class="smcap">P. M.</span>, back and
forth, so that I can get to the city much more easily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
than before. I have seen there one Henry James, a
lame man, of whom I had heard before, whom I like
very much; and he asks me to make free use of his
house, which is situated in a pleasant part of the city,
adjoining the University. I have met several people
whom I knew before, and among the rest Mr. Wright,
who was on his way to Niagara.</p>

<p>I feel already about as well acquainted with New
York as with Boston,&mdash;that is, about as little, perhaps.
It is large enough now, and they intend it shall be
larger still. Fifteenth Street, where some of my new
acquaintance live, is two or three miles from the Battery,
where the boat touches,&mdash;clear brick and stone,
and no "give" to the foot; and they have laid out,
though not built, up to the 149th street above. I had
rather see a brick for a specimen, for my part, such as
they exhibited in old times. You see it is "quite a day's
training" to make a few calls in different parts of the
city (to say nothing of twelve miles by water and land,&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>,
not brick and stone), especially if it does not
rain shillings, which might interest omnibuses in your
behalf. Some omnibuses are marked "Broadway&mdash;Fourth
Street," and they go no farther; others "Eighth
Street," and so on,&mdash;and so of the other principal
streets. (This letter will be circumstantial enough for
Helen.)</p>

<p>This is in all respects a very pleasant residence,&mdash;much
more rural than you would expect of the vicinity
of New York. There are woods all around. We breakfast
at half past six, lunch, if we will, at twelve, and
dine or sup at five; thus is the day partitioned off.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
From nine to two, or thereabouts, I am the schoolmaster,
and at other times as much the pupil as I can be.
Mr. and Mrs. Emerson are not indeed of my kith or
kin in any sense; but they are irreproachable and kind.
I have met no one yet <i>on the island</i> whose acquaintance
I shall cultivate,&mdash;or hoe round,&mdash;unless it be our
neighbor Captain Smith, an old fisherman, who catches
the fish called "moss-bonkers"&mdash;so it sounds&mdash;and
invites me to come to the beach, where he spends the
week, and see him and his fish.</p>

<p>Farms are for sale all around here, and so, I suppose
men are for purchase. North of us live Peter Wandell,
Mr. Mell, and Mr. Disosway (don't mind the spelling),
as far as the Clove road; and south, John Britton, Van
Pelt, and Captain Smith, as far as the Fingerboard road.
Behind is the hill, some 250 feet high, on the side of
which we live; and in front the forest and the sea,&mdash;the
latter at the distance of a mile and a half.</p>

<p>Tell Helen that Miss Errington is provided with assistance.
This were a good place as any to establish a
school, if one could wait a little. Families come down
here to board in the summer, and three or four have
been already established this season.</p>

<p>As for money matters, I have not set my traps yet,
but I am getting my bait ready. Pray, how does the
garden thrive, and what improvements in the pencil
line? I miss you all very much. Write soon, and send
a Concord paper to</p>

<p class="left45">
Your affectionate son,<br />
<span class="smcap i4">Henry D. Thoreau</span>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>

<p>The traps of this sportsman were magazine articles,&mdash;but
the magazines that would pay much for papers
were very few in 1843. One such had existed in Boston
for a short time,&mdash;the <i>Miscellany</i>,&mdash;and it printed
a good paper of Thoreau's, but the pay was not forthcoming.
His efforts to find publishers more liberal in
New York were not successful. But he continued to
write for fame in the <i>Dial</i>, and helped to edit that.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO MRS. EMERSON.</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Staten Island</span>, June 20, 1843.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My very dear Friend</span>,&mdash;I have only read a page
of your letter, and have come out to the top of the hill
at sunset, where I can see the ocean, to prepare to read
the rest. It is fitter that it should hear it than the walls
of my chamber. The very crickets here seem to chirp
around me as they did not before. I feel as if it were a
great daring to go on and read the rest, and then to
live accordingly. There are more than thirty vessels in
sight going to sea. I am almost afraid to look at your
letter. I see that it will make my life very steep, but it
may lead to fairer prospects than this.</p>

<p>You seem to me to speak out of a very clear and
high heaven, where any one may be who stands so
high. Your voice seems not a voice, but comes as much
from the blue heavens as from the paper.</p>

<p>My dear friend, it was very noble in you to write me
so trustful an answer. It will do as well for another
world as for this; such a voice is for no particular time
nor person, but it makes him who may hear it stand
for all that is lofty and true in humanity. The thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
of you will constantly elevate my life; it will be something
always above the horizon to behold, as when I
look up at the evening star. I think I know your
thoughts without seeing you, and as well here as in
Concord. You are not at all strange to me.</p>

<p>I could hardly believe, after the lapse of one night,
that I had such a noble letter still at hand to read,&mdash;that
it was not some fine dream. I looked at midnight
to be sure that it was real. I feel that I am unworthy to
know you, and yet they will not permit it wrongfully.</p>

<p>I, perhaps, am more willing to deceive by appearances
than you say you are; it would not be worth the
while to tell how willing; but I have the power perhaps
too much to forget my meanness as soon as seen,
and not be incited by permanent sorrow. My actual
life is unspeakably mean compared with what I know
and see that it might be. Yet the ground from which
I see and say this is some part of it. It ranges from
heaven to earth, and is all things in an hour. The experience
of every past moment but belies the faith of
each present. We never conceive the greatness of our
fates. Are not these faint flashes of light which sometimes
obscure the sun their certain dawn?</p>

<p>My friend, I have read your letter as if I was not
reading it. After each pause I could defer the rest forever.
The thought of you will be a new motive for
every right action. You are another human being
whom I know, and might not our topic be as broad as
the universe? What have we to do with petty rumbling
news? We have our own great affairs. Sometimes in
Concord I found my actions dictated, as it were, by your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
influence, and though it led almost to trivial Hindoo
observances, yet it was good and elevating. To hear
that you have sad hours is not sad to me. I rather
rejoice at the richness of your experience. Only think
of some sadness away in Pekin,&mdash;unseen and unknown
there. What a mine it is! Would it not weigh down the
Celestial Empire, with all its gay Chinese? Our sadness
is not sad, but our cheap joys. Let us be sad about
all we see and are, for so we demand and pray for
better. It is the constant prayer and whole Christian
religion. I could hope that you would get well soon,
and have a healthy body for this world, but I know
this cannot be; and the Fates, after all, are the accomplishers
of our hopes. Yet I do hope that you may
find it a worthy struggle, and life seem grand still
through the clouds.</p>

<p>What wealth is it to have such friends that we cannot
think of them without elevation! And we can think of
them any time and anywhere, and it costs nothing but
the lofty disposition. I cannot tell you the joy your
letter gives me, which will not quite cease till the latest
time. Let me accompany your finest thought.</p>

<p>I send my love to my other friend and brother, whose
nobleness I slowly recognize.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO MRS. THOREAU (AT CONCORD).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Staten Island</span>, July 7, 1843.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mother</span>,&mdash;I was very glad to get your letter
and papers. Tell Father that circumstantial letters
make very substantial reading, at any rate. I like to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
know even how the sun shines and garden grows with
you. I did not get my money in Boston, and probably
shall not at all. Tell Sophia that I have pressed some
blossoms of the tulip tree for her. They look somewhat
like white lilies. The magnolia, too, is in blossom
here.</p>

<p>Pray, have you the seventeen-year locust in Concord?
The air here is filled with their din. They come out of
the ground at first in an imperfect state, and, crawling
up the shrubs and plants, the perfect insect bursts out
through the back. They are doing great damage to the
fruit and forest trees. The latter are covered with dead
twigs, which in the distance look like the blossoms of
the chestnut. They bore every twig of last year's growth
in order to deposit their eggs in it. In a few weeks the
eggs will be hatched, and the worms fall to the ground
and enter it, and in 1860 make their appearance again.
I conversed about their coming this season before they
arrived. They do no injury to the leaves, but, beside
boring the twigs, suck their sap for sustenance. Their
din is heard by those who sail along the shore from the
distant woods,&mdash;Phar-r-r-aoh. Phar-r-r-aoh. They are
departing now. Dogs, cats, and chickens subsist mainly
upon them in some places.</p>

<p>I have not been to New York for more than three
weeks. I have had an interesting letter from Mr. Lane,<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>

describing their new prospects. My pupil and I are
getting on apace. He is remarkably well advanced in
Latin, and is well advancing.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span></p>

<p>Your letter has just arrived. I was not aware that it
was so long since I wrote home; I only knew that I
had sent five or six letters to the town. It is very
refreshing to hear from you, though it is not all good
news. But I trust that Stearns Wheeler is not dead. I
should be slow to believe it. He was made to work
very well in this world. There need be no tragedy in
his death.</p>

<p>The demon which is said to haunt the Jones family,
hovering over their eyelids with wings steeped in juice
of poppies, has commenced another campaign against
me. I am "clear Jones" in this respect at least. But
he finds little encouragement in my atmosphere, I assure
you, for I do not once fairly lose myself, except in those
hours of truce allotted to rest by immemorial custom.
However, this skirmishing interferes sadly with my literary
projects, and I am apt to think it a good day's
work if I maintain a soldier's eye till nightfall. Very
well, it does not matter much in what wars we serve,
whether in the Highlands or the Lowlands. Everywhere
we get soldiers' pay still.</p>

<p>Give my love to Aunt Louisa, whose benignant face
I sometimes see right in the wall, as naturally and necessarily
shining on my path as some star of unaccountably
greater age and higher orbit than myself. Let it
be inquired by her of George Minott, as from me,&mdash;for
she sees him,&mdash;if he has seen any pigeons yet, and
tell him there are plenty of jack snipes here. As for
William P., the "worthy young man,"&mdash;as I live, my
eyes have not fallen on him yet.</p>

<p>I have not had the influenza, though here are its headquarters,&mdash;unless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
my first week's cold was it. Tell
Helen I shall write to her soon. I have heard Lucretia
Mott. This is badly written; but the worse the writing
the sooner you get it this time from</p>

<p class="left45">
Your affectionate son,<br />
<span class="i4">H. D. T.</span></p>

<p class="center p2">TO R. W. EMERSON (AT CONCORD).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Staten Island</span>, July 8, 1843.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friends</span>,&mdash;I was very glad to hear your
voices from so far. I do not believe there are eight hundred
human beings on the globe. It is all a fable, and
I cannot but think that you speak with a slight outrage
and disrespect of Concord when you talk of fifty of
them. There are not so many. Yet think not that I
have left all behind, for already I begin to track my
way over the earth, and find the cope of heaven extending
beyond its horizon,&mdash;forsooth, like the roofs
of these Dutch houses. My thoughts revert to those
dear hills and that <i>river</i> which so fills up the world to
its brim,&mdash;worthy to be named with Mincius and
Alpheus,&mdash;still drinking its meadows while I am far
away. How can it run heedless to the sea, as if I were
there to countenance it? George Minott, too, looms up
considerably,&mdash;and many another old familiar face.
These things all look sober and respectable. They are
better than the environs of New York, I assure you.</p>

<p>I am pleased to think of Channing as an inhabitant
of the gray town. Seven cities contended for Homer
dead. Tell him to remain at least long enough to establish
Concord's right and interest in him. I was beginning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
to know the man. In imagination I see you pilgrims
taking your way by the red lodge and the cabin
of the brave farmer man, so youthful and hale, to the
still cheerful woods. And Hawthorne, too, I remember
as one with whom I sauntered, in old heroic times,
along the banks of the Scamander, amid the ruins of
chariots and heroes. Tell him not to desert, even after
the tenth year. Others may say, "Are there not the
cities of Asia?" But what are they? Staying at home
is the heavenly way.</p>

<p>And Elizabeth Hoar, my brave townswoman, to be
sung of poets,&mdash;if I may speak of her whom I do not
know. Tell Mrs. Brown that I do not forget her, going
her way under the stars through this chilly world,&mdash;I
did <i>not</i> think of the wind,&mdash;and that I went a little
way with her. Tell her not to despair. Concord's little
arch does not span all our fate, nor is what transpires
under it law for the universe.</p>

<p>And least of all are forgotten those walks in the
woods in ancient days,&mdash;too sacred to be idly remembered,&mdash;when
their aisles were pervaded as by a fragrant
atmosphere. They still seem youthful and cheery
to my imagination as Sherwood and Barnsdale,&mdash;and
of far purer fame. Those afternoons when we wandered
o'er Olympus,&mdash;and those hills, from which the sun
was seen to set, while still our day held on its way.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><p class="o1">"At last he rose and twitched his mantle blue;</p>
<p>To-morrow to fresh woods, and pastures new."</p></div></div>

<p>I remember these things at midnight, at rare intervals.
But know, my friends, that I a good deal hate you all
in my most private thoughts, as the substratum of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
little love I bear you. Though you are a rare band,
and do not make half use enough of one another.</p>

<p>I think this is a noble number of the <i>Dial</i>.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
 It
perspires thought and feeling. I can speak of it now a
little like a foreigner. Be assured that it is not written
in vain,&mdash;it is not for me. I hear its prose and its
verse. They provoke and inspire me, and they have my
sympathy. I hear the sober and the earnest, the sad
and the cheery voices of my friends, and to me it is a
long letter of encouragement and reproof; and no doubt
so it is to many another in the land. So don't give up
the ship. Methinks the verse is hardly enough better
than the prose. I give my vote for the "Notes from the
Journal of a Scholar," and wonder you don't print them
faster. I want, too, to read the rest of the "Poet and
the Painter." Miss Fuller's is a noble piece,&mdash;rich,
extempore writing, talking with pen in hand. It is too
good not to be better, even. In writing, conversation
should be folded many times thick. It is the height of
art that, on the first perusal, plain common sense should
appear; on the second, severe truth; and on a third,
beauty; and, having these warrants for its depth and
reality, we may then enjoy the beauty for evermore.
The sea-piece is of the best that is going, if not of the
best that is staying. You have spoken a good word
for Carlyle. As for the "Winter's Walk," I should be
glad to have it printed in the <i>Dial</i> if you think it good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
enough, and will criticise it; otherwise send it to me,
and I will dispose of it.</p>

<p>I have not been to New York for a month, and so
have not seen Waldo and Tappan. James has been at
Albany meanwhile. You will know that I only describe
my personal adventures with people; but I hope to see
more of them, and <i>judge</i> them too. I am sorry to learn
that Mrs. Emerson is no better. But let her know that
the Fates pay a compliment to those whom they make
sick, and they have not to ask, "What have I done?"</p>

<p>Remember me to your mother, and remember me
yourself as you are remembered by</p>

<p class="left65">
H. D. T.</p>

<p>I had a friendly and cheery letter from Lane a
month ago.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO HELEN THOREAU (AT ROXBURY).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Staten Island</span>, July 21, 1843.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Helen</span>,&mdash;I am not in such haste to write
home when I remember that I make my readers pay
the postage. But I believe I have not taxed you before.</p>

<p>I have pretty much explored this island, inland and
along the shore, finding my health inclined me to the
peripatetic philosophy. I have visited telegraph stations,
Sailors' Snug Harbors, Seaman's Retreats, Old
Elm Trees, where the Huguenots landed, Britton's
Mills, and all the villages on the island. Last Sunday
I walked over to Lake Island Farm, eight or nine miles
from here, where Moses Prichard lived, and found the
present occupant, one Mr. Davenport, formerly from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
Massachusetts, with three or four men to help him,
raising sweet potatoes and tomatoes by the acre. It
seemed a cool and pleasant retreat, but a hungry soil.
As I was coming away, I took my toll out of the soil in
the shape of arrowheads, which may after all be the
surest crop, certainly not affected by drought.</p>

<p>I am well enough situated here to observe one aspect
of the modern world at least. I mean the migratory,&mdash;the
western movement. Sixteen hundred immigrants
arrived at quarantine ground on the 4th of July, and
more or less every day since I have been here. I see
them occasionally washing their persons and clothes:
or men, women, and children gathered on an isolated
quay near the shore, stretching their limbs and taking
the air; the children running races and swinging on this
artificial piece of the land of liberty, while their vessels
are undergoing purification. They are detained but a
day or two, and then go up to the city, for the most
part without having <i>landed</i> here.</p>

<p>In the city, I have seen, since I wrote last, W. H.
Channing, at whose home, in Fifteenth Street, I spent a
few pleasant hours, discussing the all-absorbing question
"what to do for the race." (He is sadly in earnest
about going up the river to rusticate for six weeks,
and issues a new periodical called <i>The Present</i> in September.)
Also Horace Greeley, editor of the <i>Tribune</i>,
who is cheerfully in earnest, at his office of all work, a
hearty New Hampshire boy as one would wish to meet,
and says, "Now be neighborly," and believes only, or
mainly, first, in the Sylvania Association, somewhere in
Pennsylvania; and, secondly, and most of all, in a new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
association to go into operation soon in New Jersey,
with which he is connected. Edward Palmer came
down to see me Sunday before last. As for Waldo and
Tappan, we have strangely dodged one another, and
have not met for some weeks.</p>

<p>I believe I have not told you anything about Lucretia
Mott. It was a good while ago that I heard her at the
Quaker Church in Hester Street. She is a preacher,
and it was advertised that she would be present on that
day. I liked all the proceedings very well, their plainly
greater harmony and sincerity than elsewhere. They
do nothing in a hurry. Every one that walks up the
aisle in his square coat and expansive hat has a history,
and comes from a house to a house. The women come
in one after another in their Quaker bonnets and handkerchiefs,
looking all like sisters or so many chickadees.
At length, after a long silence,&mdash;waiting for the Spirit,&mdash;Mrs.
Mott rose, took off her bonnet, and began to
utter very deliberately what the Spirit suggested. Her
self-possession was something to see, if all else failed;
but it did not. Her subject was, "The Abuse of the
Bible," and thence she straightway digressed to slavery
and the degradation of woman. It was a good speech,&mdash;Transcendentalism
in its mildest form. She sat down
at length, and, after a long and decorous silence, in
which some seemed to be really digesting her words,
the elders shook hands, and the meeting dispersed. On
the whole, I liked their ways and the plainness of their
meeting-house. It looked as if it was indeed made for
service.</p>

<p>I think that Stearns Wheeler has left a gap in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
community not easy to be filled. Though he did not
exhibit the highest qualities of the scholar, he promised,
in a remarkable degree, many of the essential and rarer
ones; and his patient industry and energy, his reverent
love of letters, and his proverbial accuracy, will cause
him to be associated in my memory even with many
venerable names of former days. It was not wholly
unfit that so pure a lover of books should have ended
his pilgrimage at the great book-mart of the world. I
think of him as healthy and brave, and am confident
that if he had lived he would have proved useful in
more ways than I can describe. He would have been
authority on all matters of fact, and a sort of connecting
link between men and scholars of different walks
and tastes. The literary enterprises he was planning for
himself and friends remind me of an older and more
studious time. So much, then, remains for us to do
who survive. Love to all. Tell all my friends in Concord
that I do not send my love, but retain it still.</p>

<p>Your affectionate brother.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO MRS. THOREAU (AT CONCORD).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Staten Island</span>, August 6, 1843.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mother</span>,&mdash;As Mr. William Emerson is going
to Concord on Tuesday, I must not omit sending a
line by him,&mdash;though I wish I had something more
weighty for so direct a post. I believe I directed my
last letter to you by mistake; but it must have appeared
that it was addressed to Helen. At any rate,
this is to you without mistake.</p>

<p>I am chiefly indebted to your letters for what I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
learned of Concord and family news, and am very glad
when I get one. I should have liked to be in Walden
woods with you, but not with the railroad. I think of
you all very often, and wonder if you are still separated
from me only by so many miles of earth, or so many
miles of memory. This life we live is a strange dream,
and I don't believe at all any account men give of it.
Methinks I should be content to sit at the back door
in Concord, under the poplar tree, henceforth forever.
Not that I am homesick at all,&mdash;for places are strangely
indifferent to me,&mdash;but Concord is still a cynosure to
my eyes, and I find it hard to attach it, even in imagination,
to the rest of the globe, and tell where the
seam is.</p>

<p>I fancy that this Sunday evening you are pouring
over some select book, almost transcendental perchance,
or else "Burgh's Dignity," or Massillon, or
the <i>Christian Examiner</i>. Father has just taken one
more look at the garden, and is now absorbed in Chaptelle,
or reading the newspaper quite abstractedly, only
looking up occasionally over his spectacles to see how
the rest are engaged, and not to miss any newer news
that may not be in the paper. Helen has slipped in for
the fourth time to learn the very latest item. Sophia, I
suppose, is at Bangor; but Aunt Louisa, without doubt,
is just flitting away to some good meeting, to save the
credit of you all.</p>

<p>It is still a cardinal virtue with me to keep awake.
I find it impossible to write or read except at rare
intervals, but am, generally speaking, tougher than
formerly. I could make a pedestrian tour round the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
world, and sometimes think it would perhaps be better
to do at once the things I <i>can</i>, rather than be trying to
do what at present I cannot do well. However, I shall
awake sooner or later.</p>

<p>I have been translating some Greek, and reading
English poetry, and a month ago sent a paper to the
<i>Democratic Review</i>, which, at length, they were sorry
they could not accept; but they could not adopt the
sentiments. However, they were very polite, and earnest
that I should send them something else, or reform
that.</p>

<p>I go moping about the fields and woods here as I
did in Concord, and, it seems, am thought to be a surveyor,&mdash;an
Eastern man inquiring narrowly into the
condition and value of land, etc., here, preparatory to
an extensive speculation. One neighbor observed to
me, in a mysterious and half-inquisitive way, that he
supposed I must be pretty well acquainted with the
state of things; that I kept pretty close; he did n't see
any surveying instruments, but perhaps I had them in
my pocket.</p>

<p>I have received Helen's note, but have not heard of
Frisbie Hoar yet.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
 She is a faint-hearted writer, who
could not take the responsibility of blotting one sheet
alone. However, I like very well the blottings I get.
Tell her I have not seen Mrs. Child nor Mrs. Sedgwick.</p>

<p>Love to all from your affectionate son.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">TO R. W. EMERSON (AT CONCORD).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Staten Island</span>, August 7, 1843.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,&mdash;I fear I have nothing to send
you worthy of so good an opportunity. Of New York
I still know but little, though out of so many thousands
there are no doubt many units whom it would
be worth my while to know. Mr. James<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
 talks of going
to Germany soon with his wife to learn the language.
He says he must know it; can never learn it here;
there he may absorb it; and is very anxious to learn
beforehand where he had best locate himself to enjoy
the advantage of the highest culture, learn the language
in its purity, and not exceed his limited means.
I referred him to Longfellow. Perhaps you can help
him.</p>

<p>I have had a pleasant talk with Channing; and
Greeley, too, it was refreshing to meet. They were both
much pleased with your criticism on Carlyle, but
thought that you had overlooked what chiefly concerned
them in the book,&mdash;its practical aim and
merits.</p>

<p>I have also spent some pleasant hours with Waldo
and Tappan at their counting-room, or rather intelligence
office.</p>

<p>I must still reckon myself with the innumerable army
of invalids,&mdash;undoubtedly in a fair field they would
rout the well,&mdash;though I am tougher than formerly.
Methinks I could paint the sleepy god more truly than
the poets have done, from more intimate experience.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
Indeed, I have not kept my eyes very steadily open to
the things of this world of late, and hence have little
to report concerning them. However, I trust the awakening
will come before the last trump,&mdash;and then perhaps
I may remember some of my dreams.</p>

<p>I study the aspects of commerce at its Narrows here,
where it passes in review before me, and this seems to
be beginning at the right end to understand this Babylon.
I have made a very rude translation of the Seven
against Thebes, and Pindar too I have looked at, and
wish he was better worth translating. I believe even
the best things are not equal to their fame. Perhaps it
would be better to translate fame itself,&mdash;or is not
that what the poets themselves do? However, I have
not done with Pindar yet. I sent a long article on
Etzler's book to the <i>Democratic Review</i> six weeks ago,
which at length they have determined not to accept,
as they could not subscribe to all the opinions, but
asked for other matter,&mdash;purely literary, I suppose.
O'Sullivan wrote me that articles of this kind have to
be referred to the circle who, it seems, are represented
by this journal, and said something about "collective
we" and "homogeneity."</p>

<p>Pray don't think of Bradbury &amp; Soden<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
 any
more,&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><p class="o1">"For good deed done through praiere</p>
<p>Is sold and bought too dear, I wis,</p>
<p>To herte that of great valor is."</p></div></div>

<p>I see that they have given up their shop here.</p>

<p>Say to Mrs. Emerson that I am glad to remember
how she too dwells there in Concord, and shall send
her anon some of the thoughts that belong to her. As
for Edith, I seem to see a star in the east over where
the young child is. Remember me to Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p class="p2">These letters for the most part explain themselves,
with the aid of several to Thoreau's family, which the
purpose of Emerson, in 1865, to present his friend in a
stoical character, had excluded from the collection then
printed. Mention of C. S. Wheeler and his sad death
in Germany had come to him from Emerson, as well
as from his own family at Concord,&mdash;of whose occupations
Thoreau gives so genial a picture in the letter of
August 6 to his mother. Emerson wrote: "You will
have read and heard the sad news to the little village
of Lincoln, of Stearns Wheeler's death. Such an overthrow
to the hopes of his parents made me think more
of them than of the loss the community will suffer in
his kindness, diligence, and ingenuous mind." He died
at Leipsic, in the midst of Greek studies which have
since been taken up and carried farther by a child of
Concord, Professor Goodwin of the same university.
Henry James, several times mentioned in the correspondence,
was the moral and theological essayist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
(father of the novelist Henry James, and the distinguished
Professor James of Harvard), who was so
striking a personality in Concord and Cambridge circles
for many years. W. H. Channing was a Christian
Socialist fifty years ago,&mdash;cousin of Ellery Channing,
and nephew and biographer of Dr. Channing. Both he
and Horace Greeley were then deeply interested in the
Fourierist scheme of association, one development of
which was going on at Brook Farm, under direction
of George Ripley, and another, differing in design, at
Fruitlands, under Bronson Alcott and Charles Lane.
The jocose allusions of Thoreau to his Jones ancestors
(the descendants of the Tory Colonel Jones of Weston)
had this foundation in fact,&mdash;that his uncle, Charles
Dunbar, soon to be named in connection with Daniel
Webster, suffered from a sort of lethargy, which would
put him to sleep in the midst of conversation. Webster
had been retained in the once famous "Wyman case,"
of a bank officer charged with fraud, and had exerted
his great forensic talent for a few days in the Concord
court-house. Emerson wrote Thoreau: "You will have
heard of the Wyman trial, and the stir it made in the
village. But the Cliff and Walden knew nothing of
that."</p>

<p class="center p2">TO MRS. THOREAU (AT CONCORD).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Castleton</span>, Tuesday, August 29, 1843.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mother</span>,&mdash;Mr. Emerson has just given me
warning that he is about to send to Concord, which I
will endeavor to improve. I am a great deal more
wakeful than I was, and growing stout in other respects,&mdash;so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
that I may yet accomplish something in the literary
way; indeed, I should have done so before now
but for the slowness and poverty of the "Reviews"
themselves. I have tried sundry methods of earning
money in the city, of late, but without success: have
rambled into every bookseller's or publisher's house,
and discussed their affairs with them. Some propose to
me to do what an honest man cannot. Among others,
I conversed with the Harpers&mdash;to see if they might
not find me useful to them; but they say that they
are making $50,000 annually, and their motto is to let
well alone. I find that I talk with these poor men as
if I were over head and ears in business, and a few
thousands were no consideration with me. I almost
reproach myself for bothering them so to no purpose;
but it is a very valuable experience, and the best introduction
I could have.</p>

<p>We have had a tremendous rain here last Monday
night and Tuesday morning. I was in the city at Giles
Waldo's, and the streets at daybreak were absolutely
impassable for the water. Yet the accounts of the
storm that you may have seen are exaggerated, as indeed
are all such things, to my imagination. On Sunday
I heard Mr. Bellows preach here on the island;
but the fine prospect over the Bay and Narrows, from
where I sat, preached louder than he,&mdash;though he did
far better than the average, if I remember aright. I
should have liked to see Daniel Webster walking about
Concord; I suppose the town shook, every step he
took. But I trust there were some sturdy Concordians
who were not tumbled down by the jar, but represented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
still the upright town. Where was George
Minott? he would not have gone far to see him.
Uncle Charles should have been there,&mdash;he might as
well have been catching cat naps in Concord as anywhere.</p>

<p>And then, what a whetter-up of his memory this
event would have been! You'd have had all the classmates
again in alphabetical order reversed,&mdash;"and
Seth Hunt and Bob Smith&mdash;and he was a student of
my father's,&mdash;and where's Put now? and I wonder&mdash;you&mdash;if
Henry's been to see George Jones yet! A
little account with Stow,&mdash;Balcom,&mdash;Bigelow, poor
miserable t-o-a-d,&mdash;(sound asleep.) I vow, you,&mdash;what
noise was that?&mdash;saving grace&mdash;and few there
be&mdash;That's clear as preaching,&mdash;Easter Brooks,&mdash;morally
deprived,&mdash;How charming is divine philosophy,&mdash;some
wise and some otherwise,&mdash;Heighho!
(sound asleep again) Webster's a smart fellow&mdash;bears
his age well,&mdash;how old should you think he was?
you&mdash;does he look as if he were ten years younger
than I?"</p>

<p>I met, or rather, was overtaken by Fuller, who tended
for Mr. How, the other day, in Broadway. He dislikes
New York very much. The Mercantile Library,&mdash;that
is, its Librarian, presented me with a stranger's ticket,
for a month, and I was glad to read the Reviews there,
and Carlyle's last article. I have bought some pantaloons;
stockings show no holes yet. These pantaloons

<p class="center p2">TO R. W. EMERSON (AT CONCORD).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Staten Island</span>, September 14, 1843.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;Miss Fuller will tell you the news
from these parts, so I will only devote these few moments
to what she does n't know as well. I was
absent only one day and night from the island, the
family expecting me back immediately. I was to earn
a certain sum before winter, and thought it worth the
while to try various experiments. I carried <i>The Agriculturist</i>
about the city, and up as far as Manhattanville,
and called at the Croton Reservoir, where, indeed,
they did not want any Agriculturists, but paid well
enough in their way.</p>

<p>Literature comes to a poor market here; and even
the little that I write is more than will sell. I have
tried <i>The Dem. Review</i>, <i>The New Mirror</i>, and <i>Brother
Jonathan</i>.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
 The last two, as well as the <i>New World</i>,
are overwhelmed with contributions which cost nothing,
and are worth no more. <i>The Knickerbocker</i> is too
poor, and only <i>The Ladies' Companion</i> pays. O'Sullivan
is printing the manuscript I sent him some time ago,
having objected only to my want of sympathy with the
Committee.</p>

<p>I doubt if you have made more corrections in my
manuscript than I should have done ere this, though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
they may be better; but I am glad you have taken any
pains with it. I have not prepared any translations for
the <i>Dial</i>, supposing there would be no room, though
it is the only place for them.</p>

<p>I have been seeing men during these days, and trying
experiments upon trees; have inserted three or four
hundred buds (quite a Buddhist, one might say).
Books I have access to through your brother and
Mr. McKean, and have read a good deal. Quarles's
"Divine Poems" as well as "Emblems" are quite a
discovery.</p>

<p>I am very sorry Mrs. Emerson is so sick. Remember
me to her and to your mother. I like to think of your
living on the banks of the Mill Brook, in the midst of
the garden with all its weeds; for what are botanical
distinctions at this distance?</p>

<p class="center p2">TO HIS MOTHER (AT CONCORD).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Staten Island</span>, October 1, 1843.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mother</span>,&mdash;I hold together remarkably well
as yet,&mdash;speaking of my outward linen and woolen
man; no holes more than I brought away, and no
stitches needed yet. It is marvelous. I think the Fates
must be on my side, for there is less than a plank between
me and&mdash;Time, to say the least. As for Eldorado,
that is far off yet. My bait will not tempt the
rats,&mdash;they are too well fed. The <i>Democratic Review</i>
is poor, and can only afford half or quarter pay, which
it <i>will</i> do; and they say there is a <i>Ladies' Companion</i>
that pays,&mdash;but I could not write anything companionable.
However, speculate as we will, it is quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
gratuitous; for life, nevertheless and never the more,
goes steadily on, well or ill-fed, and clothed somehow,
and "honor bright" withal. It is very gratifying to live
in the prospect of great successes always; and for that
purpose we must leave a sufficient foreground to see
them through. All the painters prefer distant prospects
for the greater breadth of view and delicacy of tint.
But this is no news, and describes no new conditions.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I am somnambulic at least,&mdash;stirring in
my sleep; indeed, quite awake. I read a good deal, and
am pretty well known in the libraries of New York.
Am in with the librarian (one Dr. Forbes) of the Society
Library, who has lately been to Cambridge to learn
liberality, and has come back to let me take out some
un-take-out-able books, which I was threatening to
read on the spot. And Mr. McKean, of the Mercantile
Library, is a true gentleman (a former tutor of mine),
and offers me every privilege there. I have from him
a perpetual stranger's ticket, and a citizen's rights besides,&mdash;all
which privileges I pay handsomely for by
improving.</p>

<p>A canoe race "came off" on the Hudson the other
day, between Chippeways and New Yorkers, which
must have been as moving a sight as the buffalo hunt
which I witnessed. But canoes and buffaloes are all
lost, as is everything here, in the mob. It is only the
people have come to see one another. Let them advertise
that there will be a gathering at Hoboken,&mdash;having
bargained with the ferryboats,&mdash;and there will be,
and they need not throw in the buffaloes.</p>

<p>I have crossed the bay twenty or thirty times, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
have seen a great many immigrants going up to the
city for the first time: Norwegians, who carry their old-fashioned
farming-tools to the West with them, and will
buy nothing here for fear of being cheated; English
operatives, known by their pale faces and stained hands,
who will recover their birthright in a little cheap sun
and wind; English travelers on their way to the Astor
House, to whom I have done the honors of the city;
whole families of emigrants cooking their dinner upon
the pavement,&mdash;all sunburnt, so that you are in doubt
where the foreigner's face of flesh begins; their tidy
clothes laid on, and then tied to their swathed bodies,
which move about like a bandaged finger,&mdash;caps set
on the head as if woven of the hair, which is still growing
at the roots,&mdash;each and all busily cooking, stooping
from time to time over the pot, and having something
to drop in it, that so they may be entitled to take
something out, forsooth. They look like respectable
but straitened people, who may turn out to be Counts
when they get to Wisconsin, and will have this experience
to relate to their children.</p>

<p>Seeing so many people from day to day, one comes
to have less respect for flesh and bones, and thinks they
must be more loosely joined, of less firm fibre, than the
few he had known. It must have a very bad influence
on children to see so many human beings at once,&mdash;mere
herds of men.</p>

<p>I came across Henry Bigelow a week ago, sitting in
front of a hotel in Broadway, very much as if he were
under his father's stoop. He is seeking to be admitted
into the bar in New York, but as yet had not succeeded.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
I directed him to Fuller's store, which he had not found,
and invited him to come and see me if he came to the
island. Tell Mrs. and Miss Ward that I have not forgotten
them, and was glad to hear from George&mdash;with
whom I spent last night&mdash;that they had returned to C.
Tell Mrs. Brown that it gives me as much pleasure to
know that she thinks of me and my writing as if I had
been the author of the piece in question,&mdash;but I did
not even read over the papers I sent. The <i>Mirror</i> is
really the most readable journal here. I see that they
have printed a short piece that I wrote to sell, in the
<i>Dem. Review</i>, and still keep the review of "Paradise,"
that I may include in it a notice of another book by the
same author, which they have found, and are going to
send me.</p>

<p>I don't know when I shall come home; I like to keep
that feast in store. Tell Helen that I do not see any
advertisement for her, and I am looking for myself. If
I could find a rare opening, I might be tempted to try
with her for a year, till I had paid my debts, but for
such I am sure it is not well to go out of New England.
Teachers are but poorly recompensed, even here. Tell
her and Sophia (if she is not gone) to write to me.
Father will know that this letter is to him as well as to
you. I send him a paper which usually contains the
news,&mdash;if not all that is stirring, all that has stirred,&mdash;and
even draws a little on the future. I wish he would
send me, by and by, the paper which contains the results
of the Cattle-Show. You must get Helen's eyes
to read this, though she is a scoffer at honest penmanship.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">TO MRS. EMERSON (AT CONCORD).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Staten Island</span>, October 16, 1843.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,&mdash;I promised you some thoughts
long ago, but it would be hard to tell whether these are
the ones. I suppose that the great questions of "Fate,
Freewill, Foreknowledge absolute," which used to be
discussed at Concord, are still unsettled. And here
comes [W. H.] Channing, with his <i>Present</i> to vex the
world again,&mdash;a rather galvanic movement, I think.
However, I like the man all the better, though his
schemes the less. I am sorry for his confessions. Faith
never makes a confession.</p>

<p>Have you had the annual berrying party, or sat on
the Cliffs a whole day this summer? I suppose the
flowers have fared quite as well since I was not there
to scoff at them; and the hens, without doubt, keep up
their reputation.</p>

<p>I have been reading lately what of Quarles's poetry
I could get. He was a contemporary of Herbert, and a
kindred spirit. I think you would like him. It is rare
to find one who was so much of a poet and so little of
an artist. He wrote long poems, almost epics for length,
about Jonah, Esther, Job, Samson, and Solomon, interspersed
with meditations after a quite original plan,&mdash;Shepherd's
Oracles, Comedies, Romances, Fancies,
and Meditations,&mdash;the quintessence of meditation,&mdash;and
Enchiridions of Meditation all divine,&mdash;and what
he calls his Morning Muse; besides prose works as
curious as the rest. He was an unwearied Christian,
and a reformer of some old school withal. Hopelessly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
quaint, as if he lived all alone and knew nobody but
his wife, who appears to have reverenced him. He
never doubts his genius; it is only he and his God in
all the world. He uses language sometimes as greatly
as Shakespeare; and though there is not much straight
grain in him, there is plenty of tough, crooked timber.
In an age when Herbert is revived, Quarles surely
ought not to be forgotten.</p>

<p>I will copy a few such sentences as I should read to
you if there. Mrs. Brown, too, may find some nutriment
in them.</p>

<p>How does the Saxon Edith do? Can you tell yet to
which school of philosophy she belongs,&mdash;whether she
will be a fair saint of some Christian order, or a follower
of Plato and the heathen? Bid Ellen a good-night
or good-morning from me, and see if she will remember
where it comes from; and remember me to
Mrs. Brown, and your mother, and Elizabeth Hoar.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO R. W. EMERSON (AT CONCORD).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Staten Island</span>, October 17, 1843.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,&mdash;I went with my pupil to the
Fair of the American Institute, and so lost a visit from
Tappan, whom I met returning from the Island. I
should have liked to hear more news from his lips,
though he had left me a letter and the <i>Dial</i>, which
is a sort of circular letter itself. I find Channing's<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
letters full of life, and I enjoy their wit highly. Lane
writes straight and solid, like a guide-board, but I find
that I put off the "social tendencies" to a future day,
which may never come. He is always Shaker fare,
quite as luxurious as his principles will allow. I feel as
if I were ready to be appointed a committee on poetry,
I have got my eyes so whetted and proved of late, like
the knife-sharpener I saw at the Fair, certified to have
been "in constant use in a gentleman's family for more
than two years." Yes, I ride along the ranks of the
English poets, casting terrible glances, and some I blot
out, and some I spare. McKean has imported, within
the year, several new editions and collections of old
poetry, of which I have the reading, but there is a good
deal of chaff to a little meal,&mdash;hardly worth bolting.
I have just opened Bacon's "Advancement of Learning"
for the first time, which I read with great delight.
It is more like what Scott's novels <i>were</i> than
anything.</p>

<p>I see that I was very blind to send you my manuscript
in such a state; but I have a good <i>second</i> sight,
at least. I could still shake it in the wind to some advantage,
if it would hold together. There are some sad
mistakes in the printing. It is a little unfortunate that
the "Ethnical Scriptures" should hold out so well,
though it does really hold out. The Bible ought not to
be very large. Is it not singular that, while the religious
world is gradually picking to pieces its old testaments,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
here are some coming slowly after, on the seashore,
picking up the durable relics of perhaps older books,
and putting them together again?</p>

<p>Your Letter to Contributors is excellent, and hits the
nail on the head. It will taste sour to their palates at
first, no doubt, but it will bear a sweet fruit at last. I
like the poetry, especially the Autumn verses. They
ring true. Though I am quite weather-beaten with
poetry, having weathered so many epics of late. The
"Sweep Ho!" sounds well this way. But I have a
good deal of fault to find with your "Ode to Beauty."
The tune is altogether unworthy of the thoughts. You
slope too quickly to the rhyme, as if that trick had
better be performed as soon as possible, or as if you
stood over the line with a hatchet, and chopped off the
verses as they came out, some short and some long.
But give us a long reel, and we'll cut it up to suit ourselves.
It sounds like parody. "Thee knew I of old,"
"Remediless thirst," are some of those stereotyped
lines. I am frequently reminded, I believe, of Jane
Taylor's "Philosopher's Scales," and how the world</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Flew out with a bounce,"</p></div>

<p>which</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
"Yerked the philosopher out of his cell;"</p></div>

<p>or else of</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"From the climes of the sun all war-worn and weary."</p></div>

<p>I had rather have the thought come ushered with a
flourish of oaths and curses. Yet I love your poetry as
I do little else that is near and recent, especially when
you get fairly round the end of the line, and are not
thrown back upon the rocks. To read the lecture on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
"The Comic" is as good as to be in our town meeting
or Lyceum once more.</p>

<p>I am glad that the Concord farmers plowed well this
year; it promises that something will be done these summers.
But I am suspicious of that <i>Brittonner</i>, who advertises
so many cords of <i>good</i> oak, chestnut, and maple wood
for sale. <i>Good!</i> ay, good for what? And there shall
not be left a stone upon a stone. But no matter,&mdash;let
them hack away. The sturdy Irish arms that do the
work are of more worth than oak or maple. Methinks
I could look with equanimity upon a long street of Irish
cabins, and pigs and children reveling in the genial
Concord dirt; and I should still find my Walden Wood
and Fair Haven in their tanned and happy faces.</p>

<p>I write this in the corn-field&mdash;it being washing-day&mdash;with
the inkstand Elizabeth Hoar gave me;<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
 though
it is not redolent of corn-stalks, I fear. Let me not be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
forgotten by Channing and Hawthorne, nor our gray-suited
neighbor under the hill [Edmund Hosmer].</p>

<p class="p2">This letter will be best explained by a reference to
the <i>Dial</i> for October, 1843. The "Ethnical Scriptures"
were selections from the Brahminical books,
from Confucius, etc., such as we have since seen in
great abundance. The Autumn verses are by Channing;
"Sweep Ho!" by Ellen Sturgis, afterwards Mrs.
Hooper; the "Youth of the Poet and Painter" also by
Channing. The Letter to Contributors, which is headed
simply "A Letter," is by Emerson, and has been much
overlooked by his later readers; his "Ode to Beauty"
is very well known, and does not deserve the slashing
censure of Thoreau, though, as it now stands, it is better
than first printed. Instead of</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><p class="o1">"Love drinks at thy banquet</p>
<p><i>Remediless</i> thirst,"</p></div></div>

<p>we now have the perfect phrase,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><p class="o1">"Love drinks at thy <i>fountain</i></p>
<p><i>False waters of thirst</i>."</p>
</div></div>

<p>"The Comic" is also Emerson's. There is a poem,
"The Sail," by William Tappan, so often named in
these letters, and a sonnet by Charles A. Dana, afterwards
of the <i>New York Sun</i>.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO HELEN THOREAU (AT CONCORD).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Staten Island</span>, October 18, 1843.
</p>

<p>Dear Helen,&mdash;What do you mean by saying that
"<i>we</i> have written eight times by private opportunity"?
Is n't it the more the better? And am I not glad of it?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
But people have a habit of not letting me know it when
they go to Concord from New York. I endeavored to
get you <i>The Present</i> when I was last in the city, but
they were all sold; and now another is out, which I
will send, if I get it. I did not send the <i>Democratic
Review</i>, because I had no copy, and my piece was not
worth fifty cents. You think that Channing's words
would apply to me too, as living more in the natural
than the moral world; but I think that you mean the
world of men and women rather, and reformers generally.
My objection to Channing and all that fraternity
is that they need and deserve sympathy themselves
rather than are able to render it to others. They want
faith, and mistake their private ail for an infected
atmosphere; but let any one of them recover hope for
a moment, and right his <i>particular</i> grievance, and he
will no longer train in that company. To speak or do
anything that shall concern mankind, one must speak
and act as if well, or from that grain of health which
he has left. This <i>Present</i> book indeed is blue, but the
hue of its thoughts is yellow. I say these things with
the less hesitation, because I have the jaundice myself;
but I also know what it is to be well. But do not think
that one can escape from mankind who is one of them,
and is so constantly dealing with them.</p>

<p>I could not undertake to form a nucleus of an institution
for the development of infant minds, where none
already existed. It would be too cruel. And then, as if
looking all this while one way with benevolence, to walk
off another about one's own affairs suddenly! Something
of this kind is an unavoidable objection to that.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span></p>

<p>I am very sorry to hear such bad news about Aunt
Maria; but I think that the worst is always the least
to be apprehended, for nature is averse to it as well as
we. I trust to hear that she is quite well soon. I send
love to her and Aunt Jane. For three months I have
not known whether to think of Sophia as in Bangor or
Concord, and now you say that she is going directly.
Tell her to write to me, and establish her whereabouts,
and also to get well directly. And see that she has
something worthy to do when she gets down there, for
that's the best remedy for disease.</p>

<p class="left45">
Your affectionate brother,<br />
<span class="smcap i4">H. D. Thoreau.</span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span></p>

<h2>II<br />
GOLDEN AGE OF ACHIEVEMENT</h2>

<p>This was the golden age of hope and achievement for
the Concord poets and philosophers. Their ranks were
not yet broken by death (for Stearns Wheeler was hardly
one of them), their spirits were high, and their faith in
each other unbounded. Emerson wrote thus from Concord,
while Thoreau was perambulating Staten Island
and calling on "the false booksellers:" "Ellery Channing
is excellent company, and we walk in all directions.
He remembers you with great faith and hope;
thinks you ought not to see Concord again these ten
years&mdash;that you ought to grind up fifty Concords in
your mill&mdash;and much other opinion and counsel he
holds in store on this topic. Hawthorne walked with
me yesterday afternoon, and not until after our return
did I read his 'Celestial Railroad,' which has a serene
strength which we cannot afford not to praise, in this
low life."</p>

<p>The Transcendentalists had their quarterly, and
even their daily organ, for Mr. Greeley put the <i>Tribune</i>
at their service, and gave places on its staff to
Margaret Fuller and her brother-in-law Channing,
and would gladly have made room for Emerson in its
columns, if the swift utterance of a morning paper
had suited his habit of publication. While in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
<i>Tribune</i> office, Ellery Channing thus wrote to Thoreau,
after he had returned home, disappointed with New
York, to make lead pencils in his father's shop at Concord.</p>

<p class="center p2">ELLERY CHANNING TO THOREAU (AT CONCORD).</p>

<p class="address">
March 5, 1845.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Thoreau</span>,&mdash;The handwriting of your
letter is so miserable that I am not sure I have made
it out. If I have, it seems to me you are the same old
sixpence you used to be, rather rusty, but a genuine
piece. I see nothing for you in this earth but that field
which I once christened "Briars;" go out upon that,
build yourself a hut, and there begin the grand process
of devouring yourself alive. I see no alternative,
no other hope for you. Eat yourself up; you will eat
nobody else, nor anything else. Concord is just as
good a place as any other; there are, indeed, more people
in the streets of that village than in the streets of
this. This is a singularly muddy town; muddy, solitary,
and silent.</p>

<p>In your line, I have not done a great deal since I
arrived here; I do not mean the Pencil line, but the
Staten Island line, having been there once, to walk on
a beach by the telegraph, but did not visit the scene of
your dominical duties. Staten Island is very distant
from No. 30 Ann Street. I saw polite William Emerson
in November last, but have not caught any glimpse of
him since then. I am as usual suffering the various
alternations from agony to despair, from hope to fear,
from pain to pleasure. Such wretched one-sided productions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
as you know nothing of the universal man;
you may think yourself well off.</p>

<p>That baker, Hecker, who used to live on two
crackers a day, I have not seen; nor Black, nor Vethake,
nor Danesaz, nor Rynders, nor any of Emerson's
old cronies, excepting James, a little fat, rosy Swedenborgian
amateur with the look of a broker and the
brains and heart of a Pascal. William Channing, I see
nothing of him; he is the dupe of good feelings, and I
have all-too-many of these now. I have seen something
of your friends, Waldo and Tappan, and have
also seen our good man McKean, the keeper of that
stupid place, the Mercantile Library.</p>

<p class="p2">Acting on Channing's hint, and an old fancy of his
own, Thoreau, in the summer of 1845, built his cabin
at Walden and retired there; while Hawthorne entered
the Salem custom-house, and Alcott, returning defeated
from his Fruitlands paradise, was struggling with poverty
and discouragement at Concord. Charles Lane,
his English comrade, withdrew to New York or its
vicinity, and in 1846 to London, whence he had come
in 1842, full of hope and enthusiasm. A few notes of
his, or about him, may here find place. They were
sent to Thoreau at Concord, and show that Lane continued
to value his candid friend. The first, written
after leaving Fruitlands, introduces the late Father
Hecker, who had been one of the family there, to
Thoreau. The second and third relate to the sale of
the Alcott-Lane Library, and other matters.

<p class="left65"><span class="smcap">Chas. Lane</span>.</p>

<p>I hope to hear occasionally of your doings and those
of your compeers in your classic plowings and diggings.</p>

<p class="i1">
<span class="smcap">To Henry D. Thoreau</span>,<br />
<span class="i1">Concord Woods.</span></p>

<p>Thoreau's letters to Lane have not come into any
editor's hands. In England, before Lane's discovery
by Alcott, in 1842, he had been the editor of the
<i>Mark-Lane Gazette</i> (or something similar), which gave
the price-current of wheat, etc., in the English markets.
Emerson found him in Hampstead, London,
in February, 1848, and wrote to Thoreau: "I went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
last Sunday, for the first time, to see Lane at Hampstead,
and dined with him. He was full of friendliness
and hospitality; has a school of sixteen children, one
lady as matron, then Oldham. That is all the household.
They looked just comfortable."</p>

<p>"Lane instructed me to ask you to forward his
<i>Dials</i> to him, which must be done, if you can find
them. Three bound volumes are among his books in
my library. The fourth volume is in unbound numbers
at J. Munroe &amp; Co.'s shop, received there in a parcel
to my address, a day or two before I sailed, and which
I forgot to carry to Concord. It must be claimed without
delay. It is certainly there,&mdash;was opened by me
and left; and they can inclose all four volumes to Chapman
for me."</p>

<p>This would indicate that he had not lost interest in
the days and events of his American sojourn,&mdash;unpleasant
as some of these must have been to the methodical,
prosaic Englishman.</p>

<p>While at Walden, Thoreau wrote but few letters; there
is, however, a brief correspondence with Mr. J. E. Cabot,
then an active naturalist, coöperating with Agassiz in his
work on the American fishes, who had requested Thoreau
to procure certain species from Concord. The letters
were written from the cabin at Walden, and it is this
same structure that figures in the letters from Thoreau
to Emerson in England, as the proposed nucleus of the
cottage of poor Hugh the gardener, before he ran away
from Concord, as there narrated, on a subsequent page.
The first sending of river-fish was in the end of April,
1847. Then followed this letter:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">TO ELLIOT CABOT (AT BOSTON).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, May 8, 1847.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I believe that I have not yet acknowledged
the receipt of your notes, and a five-dollar bill.
I am very glad that the fishes afforded Mr. Agassiz so
much pleasure. I could easily have obtained more
specimens of the <i>Sternothærus odoratus</i>; they are quite
numerous here. I will send more of them ere long.
Snapping turtles are perhaps as frequently met with in
our muddy river as anything, but they are not always
to be had when wanted. It is now rather late in the
season for them. As no one makes a business of seeking
them, and they are valued for soups, science may
be forestalled by appetite in this market, and it will
be necessary to bid pretty high to induce persons to
obtain or preserve them. I think that from seventy-five
cents to a dollar apiece would secure all that are in
any case to be had, and will set this price upon their
heads, if the treasury of science is full enough to warrant
it.</p>

<p>You will excuse me for taking toll in the shape of
some, it may be, impertinent and unscientific inquiries.
There are found in the waters of the Concord, so far as
I know, the following kinds of fishes:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pickerel.</i> Besides the common, fishermen distinguish
the brook, or grass pickerel, which bites differently,
and has a shorter snout. Those caught in Walden,
hard by my house, are easily distinguished from those
caught in the river, being much heavier in proportion
to their size, stouter, firmer-fleshed, and lighter-colored.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
The little pickerel which I sent last, jumped into the
boat in its fright.</p>

<p><i>Pouts.</i> Those in the pond are of different appearance
from those that I have sent.</p>

<p><i>Breams.</i> Some more green, others more brown.</p>

<p><i>Suckers.</i> The horned, which I sent first, and the
black. I am not sure whether the common or Boston
sucker is found here. Are the three which I sent last,
which were speared in the river, identical with the three
black suckers, taken by hand in the brook, which I
sent before? I have never examined them minutely.</p>

<p><i>Perch.</i> The river perch, of which I sent five specimens
in the box, are darker-colored than those found
in the pond. There are myriads of small ones in the
latter place, and but few large ones. I have counted
ten transverse bands on some of the smaller.</p>

<p><i>Lampreys.</i> Very scarce since the dams at Lowell and
Billerica were built.</p>

<p><i>Shiners.</i> <i>Leuciscus chrysoleucus</i>, silver and golden.
What is the difference?</p>

<p><i>Roach</i> or <i>Chiverin</i> (<i>Leuciscus pulchellus</i>, <i>argenteus</i>,
or what not). The <i>white</i> and the <i>red</i>. The former
described by Storer, but the latter, which deserves
distinct notice, not described, to my knowledge. Are
the minnows (called here dace), of which I sent three
live specimens, I believe, one larger and two smaller,
the young of this species?</p>

<p><i>Trout.</i> Of different appearance in different brooks
in this neighborhood.</p>

<p><i>Eels.</i></p>

<p><i>Red-finned Minnows</i>, of which I sent you a dozen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
alive. I have never recognized them in any books.
Have they any scientific name?</p>

<p>If convenient, will you let Dr. Storer see these brook
minnows? There is also a kind of dace or fresh-water
smelt in the pond, which is, perhaps, distinct from any
of the above. What of the above does M. Agassiz particularly
wish to see? Does he want more specimens
of kinds which I have already sent? There are also
minks, muskrats, frogs, lizards, tortoises, snakes, caddice-worms,
leeches, muscles, etc., or rather, <i>here they are</i>.
The funds which you sent me are nearly exhausted.
Most fishes can now be taken with the hook, and it will
cost but little trouble or money to obtain them. The
snapping turtles will be the main expense. I should
think that five dollars more, at least, might be profitably
expended.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO ELLIOT CABOT (AT BOSTON).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, June 1, 1847.
</p>

<p><i>Dear Sir</i>,&mdash;I send you 15 pouts, 17 perch, 13
shiners, 1 larger land tortoise, and 5 muddy tortoises,
all from the pond by my house. Also 7 perch, 5 shiners,
8 breams, 4 dace(?), 2 muddy tortoises, 5 painted do.,
and 3 land do., all from the river. One black snake,
alive, and one dormouse(?) caught last night in my
cellar. The tortoises were all put in alive; the fishes
were alive yesterday, <i>i. e.</i>, Monday, and some this morning.
Observe the difference between those from the
pond, which is pure water, and those from the river.</p>

<p>I will send the light-colored trout and the pickerel
with the longer snout, which is our large one, when I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
meet with them. I have set a price upon the heads of
snapping turtles, though it is late in the season to get
them.</p>

<p>If I wrote red-finned eel, it was a slip of the pen; I
meant red-finned minnow. This is their name here;
though smaller specimens have but a slight reddish
tinge at the base of the pectorals.</p>

<p>Will you, at your leisure, answer these queries?</p>

<p>Do you mean to say that the twelve banded minnows
which I sent are undescribed, or only one? What are
the scientific names of those minnows which have any?
Are the four dace I send to-day identical with one of
the former, and what are they called? Is there such a
fish as the black sucker described,&mdash;distinct from the
common?</p>

<p class="center p2">AGASSIZ TO THOREAU (AT CONCORD).</p>

<p>In October, 1849, Agassiz, in reply to a request from
Thoreau that he would lecture in Bangor, sent this
characteristic letter:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I remember with much pleasure the time when you
used to send me specimens from your vicinity, and also
our short interview in the Marlborough Chapel.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
 I am
under too many obligations of your kindness to forget
it. I am very sorry that I missed your visit in Boston;
but for eighteen months I have now been settled in
Cambridge. It would give me great pleasure to engage
for the lectures you ask from me for the Bangor Lyceum;
but I find it has been last winter such a heavy
tax upon my health, that I wish for the present to make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
no engagements; as I have some hope of making my
living this year by other efforts,&mdash;and beyond the
necessity of my wants, both domestic and scientific, I
am determined not to exert myself; as all the time I
can thus secure to myself must be exclusively devoted
to science. My only business is my intercourse with
nature; and could I do without draughtsmen, lithographers,
etc., I would live still more retired. This will
satisfy you that whenever you come this way I shall
be delighted to see you,&mdash;since I have also heard something
of your mode of living."</p>

<p class="p2">Agassiz had reason indeed to remember the collections
made by Thoreau, since (from the letters of Mr.
Cabot) they aided him much in his comparison of the
American with the European fishes. When the first
firkin of Concord fish arrived in Boston, where Agassiz
was then working, "he was highly delighted, and began
immediately to spread them out and arrange them
for his draughtsman. Some of the species he had seen
before, but never in so fresh condition; others, as the
breams and the pout, he had seen only in spirits, and
the little tortoise he knew only from the books. I am
sure you would have felt fully repaid for your trouble,"
adds Mr. Cabot, "if you could have seen the eager
satisfaction with which he surveyed each fin and scale."
Agassiz himself wrote the same day: "I have been
highly pleased to find that the small mud turtle was
really the <i>Sternothærus odoratus</i>, as I suspected,&mdash;a
very rare species, quite distinct from the snapping turtle.
The suckers were all of one and the same species
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
(<i>Catastomus tuberculatus</i>); the female has the tubercles.
As I am very anxious to send some snapping turtles
home with my first boxes, I would thank Mr. T. very
much if he could have some taken for me."</p>

<p>Mr. Cabot goes on: "Of the perch Agassiz remarked
that it was almost identical with that of Europe, but
distinguishable, on close examination, by the tubercles
on the sub-operculum.... More of the painted
tortoises would be acceptable. The snapping turtles are
very interesting to him as forming a transition from the
turtles proper to the alligator and crocodile.... We
have received three boxes from you since the first."
(May 27.) "Agassiz was much surprised and pleased
at the extent of the collections you sent during his absence
in New York. Among the fishes there is one,
and probably two, new species. The fresh-water smelt
he does not know. He is very anxious to see the pickerel
with the long snout, which he suspects may be the
<i>Esox estor</i>, or Maskalongé; he has seen this at Albany....
As to the minks, etc., I know they would all be
very acceptable to him. When I asked him about these,
and more specimens of what you have sent, he said, 'I
dare not make any request, for I do not know how
much trouble I may be giving to Mr. Thoreau; but my
method of examination requires many more specimens
than most naturalists would care for.'" (June 1.)
"Agassiz is delighted to find one, and he thinks two,
more new species; one is a Pomotis,&mdash;the bream without
the red spot in the operculum, and with a red belly
and fins. The other is the shallower and lighter colored
shiner. The four dace you sent last are <i>Leuciscus argenteus</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
They are different from that you sent before
under this name, but which was a new species. Of the
four kinds of minnow, two are new. There is a black
sucker (<i>Catastomus nigricans</i>), but there has been no
specimen among those you have sent, and A. has never
seen a specimen. He seemed to know your mouse, and
called it the white-bellied mouse. It was the first specimen
he had seen. I am in hopes to bring or send him
to Concord, to look after new <i>Leucisci</i>, etc." Agassiz
did afterwards come, more than once, and examined
turtles with Thoreau.</p>

<p>Soon after this scientific correspondence, Thoreau
left his retreat by Walden to take the place of Emerson
in his household, while his friend went to visit Carlyle
and give lectures in England. The letters that follow
are among the longest Thoreau ever composed, and
will give a new conception of the writer to those who
may have figured him as a cold, stoical, or selfish person,
withdrawn from society and its duties. The first
describes the setting out of Emerson for Europe.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO SOPHIA THOREAU (AT BANGOR).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, October 24, 1847.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sophia</span>,&mdash;I thank you for those letters about
Ktaadn, and hope you will save and send me the rest,
and anything else you may meet with relating to the
Maine woods. That Dr. Young is both young and
green too at traveling in the woods. However, I hope
he got "yarbs" enough to satisfy him. I went to Boston
the 5th of this month to see Mr. Emerson off to
Europe. He sailed in the Washington Irving packet-ship;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
the same in which Mr. [F. H.] Hedge went before
him. Up to this trip the first mate aboard this ship
was, as I hear, one Stephens, a Concord boy, son of
Stephens the carpenter, who used to live above Mr.
Dennis's. Mr. Emerson's stateroom was like a carpeted
dark closet, about six feet square, with a large
keyhole for a window. The window was about as big
as a saucer, and the glass two inches thick, not to
mention another skylight overhead in the deck, the size
of an oblong doughnut, and about as opaque. Of
course it would be in vain to look up, if any contemplative
promenader put his foot upon it. Such will be
his lodgings for two or three weeks; and instead of
a walk in Walden woods he will take a promenade
on deck, where the few trees, you know, are stripped
of their bark. The steam-tug carried the ship to
sea against a head wind without a rag of sail being
raised.</p>

<p>I don't remember whether you have heard of the
new telescope at Cambridge or not. They think it is
the best one in the world, and have already seen more
than Lord Rosse or Herschel. I went to see Perez
Blood's, some time ago, with Mr. Emerson. He had
not gone to bed, but was sitting in the wood-shed, in
the dark, alone, in his astronomical chair, which is all
legs and rounds, with a seat which can be inserted at
any height. We saw Saturn's rings, and the mountains
in the moon, and the shadows in their craters, and the
sunlight on the spurs of the mountains in the dark
portion, etc., etc. When I asked him the power of his
glass, he said it was 85. But what is the power of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
Cambridge glass? 2000!!! The last is about twenty-three
feet long.</p>

<p>I think you may have a grand time this winter pursuing
some study,&mdash;keeping a journal, or the like,&mdash;while
the snow lies deep without. Winter is the time
for study, you know, and the colder it is the more studious
we are. Give my respects to the whole Penobscot
tribe, and tell them that I trust we are good
brothers still, and endeavor to keep the chain of friendship
bright, though I do dig up a hatchet now and
then. I trust you will not stir from your comfortable
winter quarters, Miss Bruin, or even put your head out
of your hollow tree, till the sun has melted the snow
in the spring, and "the green buds, they are a-swellin'."</p>

<p>From your<span class="smcap i4">Brother Henry</span>.</p>

<p>This letter will explain some of the allusions in the
first letter to Emerson in England. Perez Blood was a
rural astronomer living in the extreme north quarter of
Concord, next to Carlisle, with his two maiden sisters,
in the midst of a fine oak wood; their cottage being
one of the points in view when Thoreau and his friends
took their afternoon rambles. Sophia Thoreau, the
younger and soon the only surviving sister, was visiting
her cousins in Maine, the "Penobscot tribe" of whom
the letter makes mention, with an allusion to the Indians
of that name near Bangor. His letter to her
and those which follow were written from Emerson's
house, where Thoreau lived during the master's absence
across the ocean. It was in the orchard of this house
that Alcott was building that summer-house at which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
Thoreau, with his geometrical eye, makes merry in the
next letter.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO R. W. EMERSON (IN ENGLAND).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, November 14, 1847.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;I am but a poor neighbor to you
here,&mdash;a very poor companion am I. I understand
that very well, but that need not prevent my <i>writing</i>
to you now. I have almost never written letters in
my life, yet I think I can write as good ones as I frequently
see, so I shall not hesitate to write this, such
as it may be, knowing that you will welcome anything
that reminds you of Concord.</p>

<p>I have banked up the young trees against the winter
and the mice, and I will look out, in my careless way,
to see when a pale is loose or a nail drops out of its
place. The broad gaps, at least, I will occupy. I
heartily wish I could be of good service to this household.
But I, who have only used these ten digits so
long to solve the problem of a living, how can I? The
world is a cow that is hard to milk,&mdash;life does not
come so easy,&mdash;and oh, how thinly it is watered ere
we get it! But the young bunting calf, he will get at it.
There is no way so direct. This is to earn one's living
by the sweat of his brow. It is a little like joining a
community, this life, to such a hermit as I am; and as
I don't keep the accounts, I don't know whether the
experiment will succeed or fail finally. At any rate, it
is good for society, so I do not regret my transient nor
my permanent share in it.</p>

<p>Lidian [Mrs. Emerson] and I make very good housekeepers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
She is a very dear sister to me. Ellen and
Edith and Eddy and Aunty Brown keep up the tragedy
and comedy and tragic-comedy of life as usual. The
two former have not forgotten their old acquaintance;
even Edith carries a young memory in her head, I find.
Eddy can teach us all how to pronounce. If you should
discover any rare hoard of wooden or pewter horses, I
have no doubt he will know how to appreciate it. He
occasionally surveys mankind from my shoulders as
wisely as ever Johnson did. I respect him not a little,
though it is I that lift him up so unceremoniously. And
sometimes I have to set him down again in a hurry,
according to his "mere will and good pleasure." He
very seriously asked me, the other day, "Mr. Thoreau,
will you be my father?" I am occasionally Mr. Rough-and-tumble
with him that I may not miss <i>him</i>, and lest
he should miss <i>you</i> too much. So you must come back
soon, or you will be superseded.</p>

<p>Alcott has heard that I laughed, and so set the
people laughing, at his arbor, though I never laughed
louder than when I was on the ridge-pole. But now I
have not laughed for a long time, it is so serious. He
is very grave to look at. But, not knowing all this, I
strove innocently enough, the other day, to engage his
attention to my mathematics. "Did you ever study
geometry, the relation of straight lines to curves, the
transition from the finite to the infinite? Fine things
about it in Newton and Leibnitz." But he would hear
none of it,&mdash;men of taste preferred the natural curve.
Ah, he is a crooked stick himself. He is getting on
now so many <i>knots</i> an hour. There is one knot at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
present occupying the point of highest elevation,&mdash;the
present highest point; and as many knots as are not
handsome, I presume, are thrown down and cast into
the pines. Pray show him this if you meet him anywhere
in London, for I cannot make him hear much
plainer words here. He forgets that I am neither old
nor young, nor anything in particular, and behaves
as if I had still some of the animal heat in me. As for
the building, I feel a little oppressed when I come near
it. It has no great disposition to be beautiful; it is
certainly a wonderful structure, on the whole, and the
fame of the architect will endure as long as it shall
stand. I should not show you this side alone, if I did
not suspect that Lidian had done complete justice to
the other.</p>

<p>Mr. [Edmund] Hosmer has been working at a tannery
in Stow for a fortnight, though he has just now
come home sick. It seems that he was a tanner in his
youth, and so he has made up his mind a little at last.
This comes of reading the New Testament. Was n't
one of the Apostles a tanner? Mrs. Hosmer remains
here, and John looks stout enough to fill his own shoes
and his father's too.</p>

<p>Mr. Blood and his company have at length seen the
stars through the great telescope, and he told me that
he thought it was worth the while. Mr. Peirce made
him wait till the crowd had dispersed (it was a Saturday
evening), and then was quite polite,&mdash;conversed
with him, and showed him the micrometer, etc.; and he
said Mr. Blood's glass was large enough for all ordinary
astronomical work. [Rev.] Mr. Frost and Dr. [Josiah]
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
Bartlett seemed disappointed that there was no greater
difference between the Cambridge glass and the Concord
one. They used only a power of 400. Mr. Blood
tells me that he is too old to study the calculus or higher
mathematics. At Cambridge they think that they have
discovered traces of another satellite to Neptune. They
have been obliged to exclude the public altogether, at
last. The very dust which they raised, "which is filled
with minute crystals," etc., as professors declare, having
to be wiped off the glasses, would ere long wear
them away. It is true enough, Cambridge college is
really beginning to wake up and redeem its character
and overtake the age. I see by the catalogue that they
are about establishing a scientific school in connection
with the university, at which any one above eighteen,
on paying one hundred dollars annually (Mr. Lawrence's
fifty thousand dollars will probably diminish
this sum), may be instructed in the highest branches of
science,&mdash;in astronomy, "theoretical and practical,
with the use of the instruments" (so the great Yankee
astronomer may be born without delay), in mechanics
and engineering to the last degree. Agassiz will ere
long commence his lectures in the zoölogical department.
A chemistry class has already been formed under
the direction of Professor Horsford. A new and adequate
building for the purpose is already being erected.
They have been foolish enough to put at the end of all
this earnest the old joke of a diploma. Let every sheep
keep but his own skin, I say.</p>

<p>I have had a tragic correspondence, for the most
part all on one side, with Miss &mdash;&mdash;. She did really
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
wish to&mdash;I hesitate to write&mdash;marry me. That is the
way they spell it. Of course I did not write a deliberate
answer. How could I deliberate upon it? I sent
back as distinct a <i>no</i> as I have learned to pronounce
after considerable practice, and I trust that this <i>no</i> has
succeeded. Indeed, I wished that it might burst, like
hollow shot, after it had struck and buried itself and
made itself felt there. <i>There was no other way.</i> I really
had anticipated no such foe as this in my career.</p>

<p>I suppose you will like to hear of my book, though
I have nothing worth writing about it. Indeed, for the
last month or two I have forgotten it, but shall certainly
remember it again. Wiley &amp; Putnam, Munroe,
the Harpers, and Crosby &amp; Nichols have all declined
printing it with the least risk to themselves; but Wiley
&amp; Putnam will print it in their series, and any of them
anywhere, at <i>my</i> risk. If I liked the book well enough,
I should not delay; but for the present I am indifferent.
I believe this is, after all, the course you advised,&mdash;to
let it lie.</p>

<p>I do not know what to say of myself. I sit before
my green desk, in the chamber at the head of the stairs,
and attend to my thinking, sometimes more, sometimes
less distinctly. I am not unwilling to think great
thoughts if there are any in the wind, but what they
are I am not sure. They suffice to keep me awake
while the day lasts, at any rate. Perhaps they will redeem
some portion of the night ere long.</p>

<p>I can imagine you astonishing, bewildering, confounding,
and sometimes delighting John Bull with your
Yankee notions, and that he begins to take a pride in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
the relationship at last; introduced to all the stars of
England in succession, after the lecture, until you pine
to thrust your head once more into a genuine and unquestionable
nebula, if there be any left. I trust a common
man will be the most uncommon to you before you
return to these parts. I have thought there was some
advantage even in death, by which we "mingle with
the herd of common men."</p>

<p>Hugh [the gardener] still has his eye on the Walden
<i>agellum</i>, and orchards are waving there in the windy
future for him. That's the where-I'll-go-next, thinks
he; but no important steps are yet taken. He reminds
me occasionally of this open secret of his, with which
the very season seems to labor, and affirms seriously
that as to his wants&mdash;wood, stone, or timber&mdash;I know
better than he. That is a clincher which I shall have
to avoid to some extent; but I fear that it is a wrought
nail and will not break. Unfortunately, the day after
cattle-show&mdash;the day after small beer&mdash;he was among
the missing, but not long this time. The Ethiopian
cannot change his skin nor the leopard his spots, nor
indeed Hugh&mdash;his Hugh.</p>

<p>As I walked over Conantum, the other afternoon, I
saw a fair column of smoke rising from the woods
directly over my house that was (as I judged), and
already began to conjecture if my deed of sale would
not be made invalid by this. But it turned out to be
John Richardson's young wood, on the southeast of
your field. It was burnt nearly all over, and up to the
rails and the road. It was set on fire, no doubt, by the
same Lucifer that lighted Brooks's lot before. So you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
see that your small lot is comparatively safe for this
season, the back fire having been already set for you.</p>

<p>They have been choosing between John Keyes and
Sam Staples, if the world wants to know it, as representative
of this town, and Staples is chosen. The candidates
for governor&mdash;think of my writing this to you!&mdash;were
Governor Briggs and General Cushing, and Briggs
is elected, though the Democrats have gained. Ain't I
a brave boy to know so much of politics for the nonce?
But I should n't have known it if Coombs had n't told me.
They have had a peace meeting here,&mdash;I should n't
think of telling you if I did n't know anything would do
for the English market,&mdash;and some men, Deacon Brown
at the head, have signed a long pledge, swearing that they
will "treat all mankind as brothers henceforth." I think
I shall wait and see how they treat me first. I think
that Nature meant kindly when she made our brothers
few. However, my voice is still for peace. So good-by,
and a truce to all joking, my dear friend, from</p>

<p>Upon this letter some annotations are to be made.
"Eddy" was Emerson's youngest child, Edward Waldo,
then three years old and upward,&mdash;of late years his
father's biographer. Hugh, the gardener, of whom
more anon, bargained for the house of Thoreau on
Emerson's land at Walden, and for a field to go with
it; but the bargain came to naught, and the cabin was
removed three or four miles to the northwest, where it
became a granary for Farmer Clark and his squirrels,
near the entrance to the park known as Estabrook's.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
Edmund Hosmer was the farming friend and neighbor
with whom, at one time, G. W. Curtis and his brother
took lodgings, and at another time the Alcott family.
The book in question was "A Week on the Concord
and Merrimack Rivers."</p>

<p>To these letters Emerson replied from England:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Dear Henry</span>,&mdash;Very welcome in the parcel was
your letter, very precious your thoughts and tidings. It is
one of the best things connected with my coming hither
that you could and would keep the homestead; that fireplace
shines all the brighter, and has a certain permanent
glimmer therefor. Thanks, ever more thanks for
the kindness which I well discern to the youth of the
house: to my darling little horseman of pewter, wooden,
rocking, and what other breeds,&mdash;destined, I hope, to
ride Pegasus yet, and, I hope, not destined to be thrown;
to Edith, who long ago drew from you verses which I
carefully preserve; and to Ellen, whom by speech, and
now by letter, I find old enough to be companionable,
and to choose and reward her own friends in her own
fashions. She sends me a poem to-day, which I have
read three times!</p>

<p class="center p2">TO R. W. EMERSON (IN ENGLAND).</p>

<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, December 15, 1847.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;You are not so far off but the
affairs of <i>this</i> world still attract you. Perhaps it will be
so when we are dead. Then look out. Joshua R. Holman,
of Harvard, who says he lived a month with
[Charles] Lane at Fruitlands, wishes to <i>hire</i> said Lane's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
farm for one or more years, and will pay $125 rent, taking
out of the same a half, if necessary, for repairs,&mdash;as
for a new bank-wall to the barn cellar, which he says
is indispensable. Palmer is gone, Mrs. Palmer is going.
This is all that is known or that is worth knowing. Yes
or no? What to do?</p>

<p>Hugh's plot begins to thicken. He starts thus: eighty
dollars on one side; Walden, field and house, on the
other. How to bring these together so as to make a
garden and a palace?</p>

</table>

<p>For when one asks, "Why do you want twice as much
room more?" the reply is, "Parlor, kitchen, and bedroom,&mdash;these
make the palace."</p>

<p>"Well, Hugh, what will you do? Here are forty
dollars to buy a new house, twelve feet by twenty-five,
and add it to the old."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Thoreau, as I tell you, I know no more
than a child about it. It shall be just as you say."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span></p>

<p>"Then build it yourself, get it roofed, and get in.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Commence at one end and leave it half done,</p>
<p>And let time finish what money's begun."</p></div></div>

<p>So you see we have forty dollars for a nest egg; sitting
on which, Hugh and I alternately and simultaneously,
there may in course of time be hatched a house that will
long stand, and perchance even lay fresh eggs one day
for its owner; that is, if, when he returns, he gives the
young chick twenty dollars or more in addition, by
way of "swichin," to give it a start in the world.</p>

<p>The <i>Massachusetts Quarterly Review</i> came out the
1st of December, but it does not seem to be making
a sensation, at least not hereabouts. I know of none in
Concord who take or have seen it yet.</p>

<p>We wish to get by all possible means some notion of
your success or failure in England,&mdash;more than your
two letters have furnished. Can't you send a fair sample
both of young and of old England's criticism, if
there is any printed? Alcott and [Ellery] Channing are
equally greedy with myself.</p>

<p class="left65"><span class="smcap">Henry Thoreau</span>.</p>

<p>C. T. Jackson takes the <i>Quarterly</i> (new one), and
will lend it to us. Are you not going to send your wife
some news of your good or ill success by the newspapers?</p>

<p class="center p2">TO R. W. EMERSON (IN ENGLAND).</p>

<p class="address"><span class="smcap">Concord</span>, December 29, 1847.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,&mdash;I thank you for your letter. I
was very glad to get it; and I am glad again to write
to you. However slow the steamer, no time intervenes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
between the writing and the reading of thoughts, but
they come freshly to the most distant port. I am here
still, and very glad to be here, and shall not trouble
you with any complaints because I do not fill my place
better. I have had many good hours in the chamber
at the head of the stairs,&mdash;a solid time, it seems to me.
Next week I am going to give an account to the Lyceum
of my expedition to Maine. Theodore Parker
lectures to-night. We have had Whipple on Genius,&mdash;too
weighty a subject for him, with his antithetical definitions
new-vamped,&mdash;what it <i>is</i>, what it is <i>not</i>, but
altogether what it is <i>not</i>; cuffing it this way and cuffing
it that, as if it were an India-rubber ball. Really, it is
a subject which should expand, expand, accumulate
itself before the speaker's eyes as he goes on, like the
snowballs which the boys roll in the street; and when
it stops, it should be so large that he cannot start it,
but must leave it there. [H. N.] Hudson, too, has been
here, with a dark shadow in the core of him, and his
desperate wit, so much indebted to the surface of him,&mdash;wringing
out his words and snapping them off like a
dish-cloth; very remarkable, but not memorable. Singular
that these two best lecturers should have so much
"wave" in their timber,&mdash;their solid parts to be made
and kept solid by shrinkage and contraction of the
whole, with consequent checks and fissures.</p>

<p>Ellen and I have a good understanding. I appreciate
her genuineness. Edith tells me after her fashion: "By
and by I shall grow up and be a woman, and then I
shall remember how you exercised me." Eddy has been
to Boston to Christmas, but can remember nothing but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
the coaches, all Kendall's coaches. There is no variety
of that vehicle that he is not familiar with. He <i>did</i> try
twice to tell us something else, but, after thinking and
stuttering a long time, said, "I don't know what the
word is,"&mdash;the <i>one</i> word, forsooth, that would have
disposed of all that Boston phenomenon. If you did
not know him better than I, I could tell you more. He
is a good companion for me, and I am glad that we
are all natives of Concord. It is <i>young Concord</i>. Look
out, World!</p>

<p>Mr. Alcott seems to have sat down for the winter.
He has got Plato and other books to read. He is as
large-featured and hospitable to traveling thoughts and
thinkers as ever; but with the same Connecticut philosophy
as ever, mingled with what is better. If he
would only stand upright and toe the line!&mdash;though he
were to put off several degrees of largeness, and put on
a considerable degree of littleness. After all, I think
we must call him particularly <i>your</i> man.</p>

<p>I have pleasant walks and talks with Channing.
James Clark&mdash;the Swedenborgian that was&mdash;is at the
poorhouse, insane with too large views, so that he cannot
support himself. I see him working with Fred and
the rest. Better than be there and not insane. It is
strange that they will make ado when a man's body is
buried, but not when he thus really and tragically dies,
or seems to die. Away with your funeral processions,&mdash;into
the ballroom with them! I hear the bell toll
hourly over there.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
</p>

<p>Lidian and I have a standing quarrel as to what is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
a suitable state of preparedness for a traveling professor's
visit, or for whomsoever else; but further than
this we are not at war. We have made up a dinner, we
have made up a bed, we have made up a party, and
our own minds and mouths, three several times for
your professor, and he came not. Three several turkeys
have died the death, which I myself carved, just as if
he had been there; and the company, too, convened
and demeaned themselves accordingly. Everything was
done up in good style, I assure you, with only the part
of the professor omitted. To have seen the preparation
(though Lidian says it was nothing extraordinary) I
should certainly have said he was a-coming, but he did
not. He must have found out some shorter way to
Turkey,&mdash;some overland route, I think. By the way,
he was complimented, at the conclusion of his course
in Boston, by the mayor moving the appointment of
a committee to draw up resolutions expressive, etc.,
which was done.</p>

<p>I have made a few verses lately. Here are some,
though perhaps not the best,&mdash;at any rate they are the
shortest,&mdash;on that universal theme, yours as well as
mine, and several other people's:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><p>The good how can we trust!</p>
<p>Only the wise are just.</p>
<p>The good, we use,</p>
<p>The wise we cannot choose;</p>
<p>These there are none above.</p>
<p>The good, they know and love,</p>
<p>But are not known again</p>
<p>By those of lesser ken.</p>
<p>They do not charm us with their eyes,</p>
<p>But they transfix with their advice;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span></p>
<p>No partial sympathy they feel</p>
<p>With private woe or private weal,</p>
<p>But with the universe joy and sigh,</p>
<p>Whose knowledge is their sympathy.</p></div></div>

<p>
Good-night.     <span class="smcap i10">Henry Thoreau.</span></p>

<p>P. S.&mdash;I am sorry to send such a medley as this to
you. I have forwarded Lane's <i>Dial</i> to Munroe, and he
tells the expressman that all is right.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO R. W. EMERSON (IN ENGLAND).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, January 12, 1848.
</p>

<p>It is hard to believe that England is so near as from
your letters it appears; and that this identical piece of
paper has lately come all the way from there hither,
begrimed with the English dust which made you hesitate
to use it; from England, which is only historical
fairyland to me, to America, which I have put my
spade into, and about which there is no doubt.</p>

<p>I thought that you needed to be informed of Hugh's
progress. He has moved his house, as I told you, and
dug his cellar, and purchased stone of Sol Wetherbee
for the last, though he has not hauled it; all which has
cost sixteen dollars, which I have paid. He has also, as
next in order, run away from Concord without a penny
in his pocket, "crying" by the way,&mdash;having had another
long difference with strong beer, and a first one,
I suppose, with his wife, who seems to have complained
that he sought other society; the one difference leading
to the other, perhaps, but I don't know which was the
leader. He writes back to his wife from Sterling, near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
Worcester, where he is chopping wood, his distantly
kind reproaches to her, which I read straight through
to her (not to his bottle, which he has with him, and
no doubt addresses orally). He says that he will go on
to the South in the spring, and will never return to
Concord. Perhaps he will not. Life is not tragic
enough for him, and he must try to cook up a more
highly seasoned dish for himself. Towns which keep a
barroom and a gun-house and a reading-room, should
also keep a steep precipice whereoff impatient soldiers
may jump. His sun went down, <i>to me</i>, bright and
steady enough in the west, but it never came up in the
east. Night intervened. He departed, as when a man
dies suddenly; and perhaps wisely, if he was to go,
without settling his affairs. They knew that that was a
thin soil and not well calculated for pears. Nature is
rare and sensitive on the score of nurseries. You may
cut down orchards and grow forests at your pleasure.
Sand watered with strong beer, though stirred with industry,
will not produce grapes. He dug his cellar for
the new part too near the old house, Irish like, though
I warned him, and it has caved and let one end of the
house down. Such is the state of his domestic affairs.
I laugh with the Parcæ only. He had got the upland
and the orchard and a part of the meadow plowed by
Warren, at an expense of eight dollars, still unpaid,
which of course is no affair of yours.</p>

<p>I think that if an honest and small-familied man, who
has no affinity for moisture in him, but who has an affinity
for sand, can be found, it would be safe to rent him the
shanty as it is, and the land; or you can very easily and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
simply let nature keep them still, without great loss. It
may be so managed, perhaps, as to be a home for somebody,
who shall in return serve you as fencing stuff,
and to fix and locate your lot, as we plant a tree in the
sand or on the edge of a stream; without expense to
you in the meanwhile, and without disturbing its possible
future value.</p>

<p>I read a part of the story of my excursion to Ktaadn
to quite a large audience of men and boys, the other
night, whom it interested. It contains many facts and
some poetry. I have also written what will do for a
lecture on "Friendship."</p>

<p>I think that the article on you in <i>Blackwood's</i> is a
good deal to get from the reviewers,&mdash;the first purely
literary notice, as I remember. The writer is far enough
off, in every sense, to speak with a certain authority.
It is a better judgment of posterity than the public had.
It is singular how sure he is to be mystified by any uncommon
sense. But it was generous to put Plato into
the list of mystics. His confessions on this subject suggest
several thoughts, which I have not room to express
here. The old word <i>seer</i>,&mdash;I wonder what the reviewer
thinks that means; whether that <i>he</i> was a man who
could <i>see more than himself</i>.</p>

<p>I was struck by Ellen's asking me, yesterday, while I
was talking with Mrs. Brown, if I did not use "<i>colored</i>
words." She said that she could tell the color of a great
many words, and amused the children at school by so
doing. Eddy climbed up the sofa, the other day, <i>of his
own accord</i>, and kissed the picture of his father,&mdash;"right
on his shirt, I did."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span></p>

<p>I had a good talk with Alcott this afternoon. He is
certainly the youngest man of his age we have seen,&mdash;just
on the threshold of life. When I looked at his gray
hairs, his conversation sounded pathetic; but I looked
again, and they reminded me of the gray dawn. He is
getting better acquainted with Channing, though he says
that, if they were to live in the same house, they would
soon sit with their backs to each other.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
</p>

<p>You must excuse me if I do not write with sufficient
directness to yourself, who are a far-off traveler. It is a
little like shooting on the wing, I confess.</p>

<p>
Farewell.     <span class="smcap i10">Henry Thoreau.</span></p>

<p class="center p2">TO R. W. EMERSON (IN ENGLAND).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, February 23, 1848.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Waldo</span>,&mdash;For I think I have heard that that
is your name,&mdash;my letter which was put last into the
leathern bag arrived first. Whatever I may <i>call</i> you,
I know you better than I know your name, and what
becomes of the fittest name if in any sense you are
here with him who <i>calls</i>, and not there simply to be
called?</p>

<p>I believe I never thanked you for your lectures, one
and all, which I heard formerly read here in Concord.
I <i>know</i> I never have. There was some excellent reason
each time why I did not; but it will never be too late.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
I have that advantage, at least, over you in my education.</p>

<p>Lidian is too unwell to write to you; so I must tell
you what I can about the children and herself. I am
afraid she has not told you how unwell she is,&mdash;or to-day
perhaps we may say has been. She has been confined
to her chamber four or five weeks, and three or
four weeks, at least, to her bed, with the jaundice. The
doctor, who comes once a day, does not let her read
(nor can she now) nor <i>hear</i> much reading. She has
written her letters to you, till recently, sitting up in bed,
but he said he would not come again if she did so. She
has Abby and Almira to take care of her, and Mrs.
Brown to read to her; and I also, occasionally, have
something to read or to say. The doctor says she must
not expect to "take any comfort of her life" for a week
or two yet. She wishes me to say that she has written
two long and full letters to you about the household
economies, etc., which she hopes have not been delayed.
The children are quite well and full of spirits, and are
going through a regular course of picture-seeing, with
commentary by me, every evening, for Eddy's behoof.
All the Annuals and "Diadems" are in requisition, and
Eddy is forward to exclaim, when the hour arrives,
"Now for the demdems!" I overheard this dialogue
when Frank [Brown] came down to breakfast the other
morning.</p>

<p><i>Eddy.</i> "Why, Frank, I am astonished that you
should leave your boots in the dining-room."</p>

<p><i>Frank.</i> "I guess you mean <i>surprised</i>, don't you?"</p>

<p><i>Eddy.</i> "No, boots!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span></p>

<p>"If Waldo were here," said he, the other night, at
bedtime, "we'd be four going upstairs." Would he
like to tell papa anything? No, not anything; but
finally, yes, he would,&mdash;that one of the white horses
in his new barouche is broken! Ellen and Edith will
perhaps speak for themselves, as I hear something
about letters to be written by them.</p>

<p>Mr. Alcott seems to be reading well this winter:
Plato, Montaigne, Ben Jonson, Beaumont and Fletcher,
Sir Thomas Browne, etc., etc. "I believe I have read
them all now, or nearly all,"&mdash;those English authors.
He is rallying for another foray with his pen, in his latter
years, not discouraged by the past, into that crowd
of unexpressed ideas of his, that undisciplined Parthian
army, which, as soon as a Roman soldier would face,
retreats on all hands, occasionally firing backwards;
easily routed, not easily subdued, hovering on the skirts
of society. Another summer shall not be devoted to
the raising of vegetables (Arbors?) which rot in the
cellar for want of consumers; but perchance to the
arrangement of the material, the brain-crop which the
winter has furnished. I have good talks with him. His
respect for Carlyle has been steadily increasing for some
time. He has read him with new sympathy and appreciation.</p>

<p>I see Channing often. He also goes often to Alcott's,
and confesses that he has made a discovery in him, and
gives vent to his admiration or his confusion in characteristic
exaggeration; but between this extreme and that
you may get a fair report, and draw an inference if you
can. Sometimes he will ride a broomstick still, though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
there is nothing to keep him, or it, up but a certain
centrifugal force of whim, which is soon spent, and there
lies your stick, not worth picking up to sweep an oven
with now. His accustomed path is strewn with them.
But then again, and perhaps for the most part, he sits
on the Cliffs amid the lichens, or flits past on noiseless
pinion, like the barred owl in the daytime, as wise and
unobserved. He brought me a poem the other day, for
me, on Walden Hermitage: not remarkable.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
</p>

<p>Lectures begin to multiply on my desk. I have one
on Friendship which is new, and the materials of some
others. I read one last week to the Lyceum, on The
Rights and Duties of the Individual in Relation to Government,&mdash;much
to Mr. Alcott's satisfaction.</p>

<p>Joel Britton has failed and gone into chancery, but
the woods continue to fall before the axes of other men.
Neighbor Coombs<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
 was lately found dead in the woods
near Goose Pond, with his half-empty jug, after he had
been rioting a week. Hugh, by the last accounts, was
still in Worcester County. Mr. Hosmer, who is himself
again, and living in Concord, has just hauled the rest
of your wood, amounting to about ten and a half cords.</p>

<p>The newspapers say that they have printed a pirated
edition of your Essays in England. Is it as bad as they
say, and undisguised and unmitigated piracy? I thought
that the printed scrap would entertain Carlyle, notwithstanding
its history. If this generation will see
out of its hind-head, why then you may turn your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
back on its forehead. Will you forward it to him for
me?</p>

<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, March 8, 1848.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Mr. Emerson's address is as yet, "R.
W. Emerson, care of Alexander Ireland, Esq., Examiner
Office, Manchester, England." We had a letter
from him on Monday, dated at Manchester, February
10, and he was then preparing to go to Edinburgh the
next day, where he was to lecture. He thought that he
should get through his northern journeying by the 25th
of February, and go to London to spend March and
April, and if he did not go to Paris in May, then come
home. He has been eminently successful, though the
papers this side of the water have been so silent about
his adventures.

<p>My book,<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
 fortunately, did not find a publisher ready
to undertake it, and you can imagine the effect of delay
on an author's estimate of his own work. However, I
like it well enough to mend it, and shall look at it again
directly when I have dispatched some other things.</p>

<p>I have been writing lectures for our own Lyceum
this winter, mainly for my own pleasure and advantage.
I esteem it a rare happiness to be able to <i>write</i> anything,
but there (if I ever get there) my concern for it
is apt to end. Time &amp; Co. are, after all, the only quite
honest and trustworthy publishers that we know. I
can sympathize, perhaps, with the barberry bush, whose
business it is solely to <i>ripen</i> its fruit (though that may
not be to sweeten it) and to protect it with thorns, so
that it holds on all winter, even, unless some hungry
crows come to pluck it. But I see that I must get a
few dollars together presently to manure my roots. Is
your journal able to pay anything, provided it likes an
article well enough? I do not promise one. At any
rate, I mean always to spend only words enough to
purchase silence with; and I have found that this,
which is so valuable, though many writers do not prize
it, does not cost much, after all.</p>

<p>I have not obtained any more of the mice which I
told you were so numerous in my cellar, as my house
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
was removed immediately after I saw you, and I have
been living in the village since.</p>

<p>However, if I should happen to meet with anything
rare, I will forward it to you. I thank you for your kind
offers, and will avail myself of them so far as to ask if
you can anywhere borrow for me for a short time the
copy of the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i> containing a notice
of Mr. Emerson. I should like well to read it, and to
read it to Mrs. Emerson and others. If this book is not
easy to be obtained, do not by any means trouble yourself
about it.</p>

<p>P. S.&mdash;I have received three newspapers from you
duly which I have not acknowledged. There is an anti-Sabbath
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
convention held in Boston to-day, to which
Alcott has gone.</p>

<p class="p2">That friend to whom Thoreau wrote most constantly
and fully, on all topics, was Mr. Harrison Blake of
Worcester, a graduate of Harvard two years earlier
than Thoreau, in the same class with two other young
men from Concord,&mdash;E. R. Hoar and H. B. Dennis.
This circumstance may have led to Mr. Blake's visiting
the town occasionally, before his intimacy with its poet-naturalist
began, in the year 1848. At that time, as
Thoreau wrote to Horace Greeley, he had been supporting
himself for five years wholly by the labor of his
hands; his Walden hermit life was over, yet neither its
record nor the first book had been published, and
Thoreau was known in literature chiefly by his papers
in the <i>Dial</i>, which had then ceased for four years.
In March, 1848, Mr. Blake read Thoreau's chapter on
Persius in the <i>Dial</i> for July, 1840,&mdash;and though he
had read it before without being much impressed by
it, he now found in it "pure depth and solidity of
thought." "It has revived in me," he wrote to Thoreau,
"a haunting impression of you, which I carried away
from some spoken words of yours.... When I was
last in Concord, you spoke of retiring farther from our
civilization. I asked you if you would feel no longings
for the society of your friends. Your reply was in substance,
'No, I am nothing.' That reply was memorable
to me. It indicated a depth of resources, a completeness
of renunciation, a poise and repose in the
universe, which to me is almost inconceivable; which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
in you seemed domesticated, and to which I look up
with veneration. I would know of that soul which can
say 'I am nothing.' I would be roused by its words to
a truer and purer life. Upon me seems to be dawning
with new significance the idea that God is here; that
we have but to bow before Him in profound submission
at every moment, and He will fill our souls with his
presence. In this opening of the soul to God, all duties
seem to centre; what else have we to do?... If I
understand rightly the significance of your life, this is
it: You would sunder yourself from society, from the
spell of institutions, customs, conventionalities, that you
may lead a fresh, simple life with God. Instead of
breathing a new life into the old forms, you would have
a new life without and within. There is something
sublime to me in this attitude,&mdash;far as I may be from
it myself.... Speak to me in this hour as you are
prompted.... I honor you because you abstain from
action, and open your soul that you may <i>be</i> somewhat.
Amid a world of noisy, shallow actors it is noble to
stand aside and say, 'I will simply <i>be</i>.' Could I plant
myself at once upon the truth, reducing my wants to
their minimum, ... I should at once be brought
nearer to nature, nearer to my fellow-men,&mdash;and life
would be infinitely richer. But, alas! I shiver on the
brink."</p>

<p>Thus appealed to by one who had so well attained
the true Transcendental shibboleth,&mdash;"God working
in us, both to will and to do,"&mdash;Thoreau could not
fail to make answer, as he did at once, and thus:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER).</p>

<p class="center">[The first of many letters.]</p>

<p class="address"><span class="smcap">Concord</span>, March 27, 1848.</p>

<p>I am glad to hear that any words of mine, though
spoken so long ago that I can hardly claim identity
with their author, have reached you. It gives me
pleasure, because I have therefore reason to suppose
that I have uttered what concerns men, and that it is
not in vain that man speaks to man. This is the value
of literature. Yet those days are so distant, in every
sense, that I have had to look at that page again, to
learn what was the tenor of my thoughts then. I should
value that article, however, if only because it was the
occasion of your letter.</p>

<p>I do believe that the outward and the inward life
correspond; that if any should succeed to live a higher
life, others would not know of it; that difference and
distance are one. To set about living a true life is to
go a journey to a distant country, gradually to find ourselves
surrounded by new scenes and men; and as long
as the old are around me, I know that I am not in any
true sense living a new or a better life. The outward
is only the outside of that which is within. Men are
not concealed under habits, but are revealed by them;
they are their true clothes. I care not how curious a
reason they may give for their abiding by them. Circumstances
are not rigid and unyielding, but our habits
are rigid. We are apt to speak vaguely sometimes, as
if a divine life were to be grafted on to or built over
this present as a suitable foundation. This might do if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
we could so build over our old life as to exclude from
it all the warmth of our affection, and addle it, as the
thrush builds over the cuckoo's egg, and lays her own
atop, and hatches that only; but the fact is, we&mdash;so
thin is the partition&mdash;hatch them both, and the
cuckoo's always by a day first, and that young bird
crowds the young thrushes out of the nest. No. Destroy
the cuckoo's egg, or build a new nest.</p>

<p>Change is change. No new life occupies the old
bodies;&mdash;they decay. <i>It</i> is born, and grows, and flourishes.
Men very pathetically inform the old, accept
and wear it. Why put up with the almshouse when
you may go to heaven? It is embalming,&mdash;no more.
Let alone your ointments and your linen swathes, and
go into an infant's body. You see in the catacombs of
Egypt the result of that experiment,&mdash;that is the end
of it.</p>

<p>I do believe in simplicity. It is astonishing as well
as sad, how many trivial affairs even the wisest man
thinks he must attend to in a day; how singular an
affair he thinks he must omit. When the mathematician
would solve a difficult problem, he first frees the
equation of all incumbrances, and reduces it to its simplest
terms. So simplify the problem of life, distinguish
the necessary and the real. Probe the earth to see
where your main roots run. I would stand upon facts.
Why not see,&mdash;use our eyes? Do men know nothing?
I know many men who, in common things, are not to
be deceived; who trust no moonshine; who count their
money correctly, and know how to invest it; who are
said to be prudent and knowing, who yet will stand at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
a desk the greater part of their lives, as cashiers in
banks, and glimmer and rust and finally go out there.
If they <i>know</i> anything, what under the sun do they do
that for? Do they know what <i>bread</i> is? or what it is
for? Do they know what life is? If they <i>knew</i> something,
the places which know them now would know
them no more forever.</p>

<p>This, our respectable daily life, on which the man of
common sense, the Englishman of the world, stands so
squarely, and on which our institutions are founded, is
in fact the veriest illusion, and will vanish like the
baseless fabric of a vision; but that faint glimmer of
reality which sometimes illuminates the darkness of
daylight for all men, reveals something more solid and
enduring than adamant, which is in fact the cornerstone
of the world.</p>

<p>Men cannot conceive of a state of things so fair that
it cannot be realized. Can any man honestly consult
his experience and say that it is so? Have we any
facts to appeal to when we say that our dreams are
premature? Did you ever hear of a man who had
striven all his life faithfully and singly toward an object
and in no measure obtained it? If a man constantly
aspires, is he not elevated? Did ever a man
try heroism, magnanimity, truth, sincerity, and find that
there was no advantage in them? that it was a vain
endeavor? Of course we do not expect that our paradise
will be a garden. We know not what we ask. To
look at literature;&mdash;how many fine thoughts has every
man had! how few fine thoughts are expressed! Yet
we never have a fantasy so subtle and ethereal, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
that <i>talent merely</i>, with more resolution and faithful
persistency, after a thousand failures, might fix and
engrave it in distinct and enduring words, and we
should see that our dreams are the solidest facts that
we know. But I speak not of dreams.</p>

<p>What can be expressed in words can be expressed in
life.</p>

<p>My actual life is a fact, in view of which I have no
occasion to congratulate myself; but for my faith and
aspiration I have respect. It is from these that I speak.
Every man's position is in fact too simple to be described.
I have sworn no oath. I have no designs on
society, or nature, or God. I am simply what I am, or
I begin to be that. I <i>live</i> in the <i>present</i>. I only remember
the past, and anticipate the future. I love to
live. I love reform better than its modes. There is no
history of how bad became better. I believe something,
and there is nothing else but that. I know that I am.
I know that another is who knows more than I, who
takes interest in me, whose creature, and yet whose
kindred, in one sense, am I. I know that the enterprise
is worthy. I know that things work well. I have
heard no bad news.</p>

<p>As for positions, combinations, and details,&mdash;what
are they? In clear weather, when we look into the
heavens, what do we see but the sky and the sun?</p>

<p>If you would convince a man that he does wrong, do
right. But do not care to convince him. Men will
believe what they see. Let them see.</p>

<p>Pursue, keep up with, circle round and round your
life, as a dog does his master's chaise. Do what you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
love. Know your own bone; gnaw at it, bury it, unearth
it, and gnaw it still. Do not be too moral. You
may cheat yourself out of much life so. Aim above
morality. Be not simply good; be good for something.
All fables, indeed, have their morals; but the innocent
enjoy the story. Let nothing come between you and
the light. Respect men and brothers only. When you
travel to the Celestial City, carry no letter of introduction.
When you knock, ask to see God,&mdash;none of the
servants. In what concerns you much, do not think
that you have companions: know that you are alone
in the world.</p>

<p>Thus I write at random. I need to see you, and I
trust I shall, to correct my mistakes. Perhaps you have
some oracles for me.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER).</p>

<p class="address"><span class="smcap">Concord</span>, May 2, 1848</p>

<p>"We must have our bread." But what is our bread?
Is it baker's bread? Methinks it should be very <i>home-made</i>
bread. What is our meat? Is it butcher's meat?
What is that which we <i>must</i> have? Is that bread which
we are now earning sweet? Is it not bread which has
been suffered to sour, and then been sweetened with
an alkali, which has undergone the vinous, the acetous,
and sometimes the putrid fermentation, and then been
whitened with vitriol? Is this the bread which we must
have? Man must earn his bread by the sweat of his
brow, truly, but also by the sweat of his brain within
his brow. The body can feed the body only. I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
tasted but little bread in my life. It has been mere
grub and provender for the most part. Of bread that
nourished the brain and the heart, scarcely any. There
is absolutely none on the tables even of the rich.</p>

<p>There is not one kind of food for all men. You
must and you will feed those faculties which you exercise.
The laborer whose body is weary does not require
the same food with the scholar whose brain is weary.
Men should not labor foolishly like brutes, but the
brain and the body should always, or as much as possible,
work and rest together, and then the work will
be of such a kind that when the body is hungry the
brain will be hungry also, and the same food will suffice
for both; otherwise the food which repairs the
waste energy of the overwrought body will oppress the
sedentary brain, and the degenerate scholar will come to
esteem all food vulgar, and all getting a living drudgery.</p>

<p>How shall we earn our bread is a grave question;
yet it is a sweet and inviting question. Let us not
shirk it, as is usually done. It is the most important
and practical question which is put to man. Let us
not answer it hastily. Let us not be content to get our
bread in some gross, careless, and hasty manner. Some
men go a-hunting, some a-fishing, some a-gaming, some
to war; but none have so pleasant a time as they who
in earnest seek to earn their bread. It is true actually
as it is true really; it is true materially as it is true spiritually,
that they who seek honestly and sincerely, with
all their hearts and lives and strength, to earn their
bread, do earn it, and it is sure to be very sweet to
them. A very little bread,&mdash;a very few crumbs are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
enough, if it be of the right quality, for it is infinitely
nutritious. Let each man, then, earn at least a crumb
of bread for his body before he dies, and know the taste
of it,&mdash;that it is identical with the bread of life, and
that they both go down at one swallow.</p>

<p>Our bread need not ever be sour or hard to digest.
What Nature is to the mind she is also to the body.
As she feeds my imagination, she will feed my body;
for what she says she means, and is ready to do. She
is not simply beautiful to the poet's eye. Not only the
rainbow and sunset are beautiful, but to be fed and
clothed, sheltered and warmed aright, are equally beautiful
and inspiring. There is not necessarily any gross
and ugly fact which may not be eradicated from the
life of man. We should endeavor practically in our
lives to correct all the defects which our imagination
detects. The heavens are as deep as our aspirations are
high. So high as a tree aspires to grow, so high it will
find an atmosphere suited to it. Every man should
stand for a force which is perfectly irresistible. How
can any man be weak who dares <i>to be</i> at all? Even
the tenderest plants force their way up through the
hardest earth and the crevices of rocks; but a man no
material power can resist. What a wedge, what a beetle,
what a catapult, is an <i>earnest</i> man! What can resist
him?</p>

<p>It is a momentous fact that a man may be <i>good</i>, or
he may be <i>bad</i>; his life may be <i>true</i>, or it may be <i>false</i>;
it may be either a shame or a glory to him. The good
man builds himself up; the bad man destroys himself.</p>

<p>But whatever we do we must do confidently (if we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
are timid, let us, then, act timidly), not expecting more
light, but having light enough. If we confidently expect
more, then let us wait for it. But what is this which
we have? Have we not already waited? Is this the
beginning of time? Is there a man who does not see
clearly beyond, though only a hair's breadth beyond
where he at any time stands?</p>

<p>If one hesitates in his path, let him not proceed. Let
him respect his doubts, for doubts, too, may have some
divinity in them, That we have but little faith is not
sad, but that we have but little faithfulness. By faithfulness
faith is earned. When, in the progress of a life,
a man swerves, though only by an angle infinitely small,
from his proper and allotted path (and this is never
done quite unconsciously even at first; in fact, that was
his broad and scarlet sin,&mdash;ah, he knew of it more than
he can tell), then the drama of his life turns to tragedy,
and makes haste to its fifth act. When once we thus
fall behind ourselves, there is no accounting for the obstacles
which rise up in our path, and no one is so wise
as to advise, and no one so powerful as to aid us while
we abide on that ground. Such are cursed with <i>duties</i>,
and the <i>neglect of their duties</i>. For such the decalogue
was made, and other far more voluminous and terrible
codes.</p>

<p>These departures,&mdash;who have not made them?&mdash;for
they are as faint as the parallax of a fixed star, and
at the commencement we say they are nothing,&mdash;that
is, they originate in a kind of sleep and forgetfulness of
the soul when it is naught. A man cannot be too circumspect
in order to keep in the straight road, and be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
sure that he sees all that he may at any time see, that
so he may distinguish his true path.</p>

<p>You ask if there is no doctrine of sorrow in my philosophy.
Of acute sorrow I suppose that I know comparatively
little. My saddest and most genuine sorrows
are apt to be but transient regrets. The place of sorrow
is supplied, perchance, by a certain hard and proportionately
barren indifference. I am of kin to the sod,
and partake largely of its dull patience,&mdash;in winter
expecting the sun of spring. In my cheapest moments
I am apt to think that it is n't my business to be "seeking
the spirit," but as much its business to be seeking
me. I know very well what Goethe meant when he said
that he never had a chagrin but he made a poem out
of it. I have altogether too much patience of this kind.
I am too easily contented with a slight and almost
animal happiness. My happiness is a good deal like
that of the woodchucks.</p>

<p>Methinks I am never quite committed, never wholly
the creature of my moods, but always to some extent
their critic. My only integral experience is in my
vision. I see, perchance, with more integrity than I feel.</p>

<p>But I need not tell you what manner of man I am,&mdash;my
virtues or my vices. You can guess if it is worth
the while; and I do not discriminate them well.</p>

<p>I do not write this at my hut in the woods. I am at
present living with Mrs. Emerson, whose house is an
old home of mine, for company during Mr. Emerson's
absence.</p>

<p>You will perceive that I am as often talking to myself,
perhaps, as speaking to you.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">Here is a confession of faith, and a bit of self-portraiture
worth having; for there is little except faithful
statement of the fact. Its sentences are based on the
questions and experiences of his correspondent; yet
they diverge into that atmosphere of humor and hyperbole
so native to Thoreau; in whom was the oddest
mixture of the serious and the comic, the literal and
the romantic. He addressed himself also, so far as his
unbending personality would allow, to the mood or the
need of his correspondent; and he had great skill in
fathoming character and describing in a few touches
the persons he encountered; as may be seen in his
letters to Emerson, especially, who also had, and in
still greater measure, this "fatal gift of penetration,"
as he once termed it. This will be seen in the contrast
of Thoreau's correspondence with Mr. Blake, and that
he was holding at the same time with Horace Greeley,&mdash;persons
radically unlike.</p>

<p>In August, 1846, Thoreau sent to Greeley his essay
on Carlyle, asking him to find a place for it in some
magazine. Greeley sent it to R. W. Griswold, then
editing <i>Graham's Magazine</i> in Philadelphia, who accepted
it and promised to pay for it, but did not
publish it till March and April, 1847; even then the
promised payment was not forthcoming. On the 31st
of March, 1848, a year and a half after it had been
put in Griswold's possession, Thoreau wrote again to
Greeley, saying that no money had come to hand. At
once, and at the very time when Mr. Blake was opening
his spiritual state to Thoreau (April 3, 1848), the busy
editor of the <i>Tribune</i> replied: "It saddens and surprises
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
me to know that your article was not paid for by
Graham; and, since my honor is involved, I will see
that you are paid, and that at no distant day." Accordingly,
on May 17, he adds: "To-day I have been
able to lay my hand on the money due you. I made
out a regular bill for the contribution, drew a draft on
G. R. Graham for the amount, gave it to his brother
in New York for collection, and received the money.
I have made Graham pay you seventy-five dollars, but
I only send you fifty dollars," having deducted twenty-five
dollars for the advance of that sum he had made
a month before to Thoreau for his "Ktaadn and the
Maine Woods," which finally came out in <i>Sartain's
Union Magazine</i> of Philadelphia, late in 1848. To
this letter and remittance of fifty dollars Thoreau
replied, May 19, 1848, substantially thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center p2">TO HORACE GREELEY (AT NEW YORK).</p>

<p class="address"><span class="smcap">Concord</span>, May 19, 1848.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Friend Greeley</span>,&mdash;I have to-day received from
you fifty dollars. It is five years that I have been maintaining
myself entirely by manual labor,&mdash;not getting
a cent from any other quarter or employment. Now
this toil has occupied so few days,&mdash;perhaps a single
month, spring and fall each,&mdash;that I must have had
more leisure than any of my brethren for study and
literature. I have done rude work of all kinds. From
July, 1845, to September, 1847, I lived by myself in
the forest, in a fairly good cabin, plastered and warmly
covered, which I built myself. There I earned all I
needed, and kept to my own affairs. During that time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
my weekly outlay was but seven and twenty cents; and
I had an abundance of all sorts. Unless the human
race perspire more than I do, there is no occasion to live
by the sweat of their brow. If men cannot get on
without money (the smallest amount will suffice), the
truest method of earning it is by working as a laborer
at one dollar per day. You are least dependent so; I
speak as an expert, having used several kinds of labor.</p>

<p>Why should the scholar make a constant complaint
that his fate is specially hard? We are too often told
of "the pursuit of knowledge under difficulties,"&mdash;how
poets depend on patrons and starve in garrets, or at
last go mad and die. Let us hear the other side of the
story. Why should not the scholar, if he is really wiser
than the multitude, do coarse work now and then?
Why not let his greater wisdom enable him to do without
things? If you say the wise man is unlucky, how
could you distinguish him from the foolishly unfortunate?</p>

<p>My friend, how can I thank you for your kindness?
Perhaps there is a better way,&mdash;I will convince you
that it is felt and appreciated. Here have I been sitting
idle, as it were, while you have been busy in my cause,
and have done so much for me. I wish you had had a
better subject; but good deeds are no less good because
their object is unworthy.</p>

<p>Yours was the best way to collect money,&mdash;but I
should never have thought of it; I might have waylaid
the debtor perchance. Even a business man might not
have thought of it,&mdash;and I cannot be called that, as
business is understood usually,&mdash;not being familiar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
with the routine. But your way has this to commend
it also,&mdash;if you make the draft, you decide how much
to draw. You drew just the sum suitable.</p>

<p>The Ktaadn paper can be put in the guise of letters,
if it runs best so; dating each part on the day it
describes. Twenty-five dollars more for it will satisfy
me; I expected no more, and do not hold you to pay
that,&mdash;for you asked for something else, and there was
delay in sending. So, if you use it, send me twenty-five
dollars now or after you sell it, as is most convenient;
but take out the expenses that I see you must have had.
In such cases carriers generally get the most; but you,
as carrier here, get no money, but risk losing some,
besides much of your time; while I go away, as I must,
giving you unprofitable thanks. Yet trust me, my
pleasure in your letter is not wholly a selfish one. May
my good genius still watch over me and my added
wealth!</p>

<p>P. S.&mdash;My book grows in bulk as I work on it; but
soon I shall get leisure for those shorter articles you
want,&mdash;then look out.</p>

<p class="p2">The "book," of course, was the "Week," then about
to go through the press; the shorter articles were some
that Greeley suggested for the Philadelphia magazines.
Nothing came of this, but the correspondence was kept
up until 1854, and led to the partial publication of
"Cape Cod" and "The Yankee in Canada" in the
newly launched <i>Putnam's Magazine</i>, of which G. W.
Curtis was editor. But he differed with Thoreau on a
matter of style or opinion (the articles appearing as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
anonymous, or editorial), and the author withdrew his
MS. The letters of Greeley in this entertaining series
are all preserved; but Greeley seems to have given
Thoreau's away for autographs; and the only one accessible
as yet is that just paraphrased.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT MILTON).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Blake</span>,&mdash;I write now chiefly to say, before it

and will give you a chamber, etc., in my father's

<p>I am in too great haste this time to speak to your,
or out of my, condition. I might say,&mdash;you might say,&mdash;comparatively
speaking, be not anxious to avoid
poverty. In this way the wealth of the universe may

of life. We must act with so rapid and resistless a purpose
in <i>one</i> direction, that our vices will necessarily
trail behind. The nucleus of a comet is almost a star.
Was there ever a genuine dilemma? The laws of earth
are for the feet, or inferior man; the laws of heaven
are for the head, or superior man; the latter are the
former sublimed and expanded, even as radii from
the earth's centre go on diverging into space. Happy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
the man who observes the heavenly and the terrestrial
law in just proportion; whose every faculty, from the
soles of his feet to the crown of his head, obeys the law
of its level; who neither stoops nor goes on tiptoe, but
lives a balanced life, acceptable to nature and to God.</p>

<p>These things I say; other things I do.</p>

<p>I am sorry to hear that you did not receive my book
earlier. I directed it and left it in Munroe's shop to
be sent to you immediately, on the twenty-sixth of
May, before a copy had been sold.</p>

<p>Will you remember me to Mr. Brown, when you see
him next: he is well remembered by</p>

<p class="left65"><span class="smcap">Henry Thoreau</span>.</p>

<p>I still owe you a worthy answer.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO HARRISON BLAKE.</p>

<p class="address"><span class="smcap">Concord</span>, November 20, 1849.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Blake</span>,&mdash;I have not forgotten that I am your
debtor. When I read over your letters, as I have just
done, I feel that I am unworthy to have received or to
answer them, though they are addressed, as I would
have them, to the ideal of me. It behooves me, if
I would reply, to speak out of the rarest part of myself.</p>

<p>At present I am subsisting on certain wild flavors
which nature wafts to me, which unaccountably sustain
me, and make my apparently poor life rich.
Within a year my walks have extended themselves,
and almost every afternoon (I read, or write, or make
pencils in the forenoon, and by the last means get a
living for my body) I visit some new hill, or pond, or
wood, many miles distant. I am astonished at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
wonderful retirement through which I move, rarely
meeting a man in these excursions, never seeing one
similarly engaged, unless it be my companion, when I
have one. I cannot help feeling that of all the human
inhabitants of nature hereabouts, only we two have
leisure to admire and enjoy our inheritance.</p>

<p>"Free in this world as the birds in the air, disengaged
from every kind of chains, those who have practiced
the <i>yoga</i> gather in Brahma the certain fruit of
their works."</p>

<p>Depend upon it that, rude and careless as I am, I
would fain practice the <i>yoga</i> faithfully.</p>

<p>"The yogi, absorbed in contemplation, contributes
in his degree to creation: he breathes a divine perfume,
he hears wonderful things. Divine forms traverse
him without tearing him, and, united to the
nature which is proper to him, he goes, he acts as animating
original matter."</p>

<p>To some extent, and at rare intervals, even I am a
yogi.</p>

<p>I know little about the affairs of Turkey, but I am
sure that I know something about barberries and chestnuts,
of which I have collected a store this fall. When
I go to see my neighbor, he will formally communicate
to me the latest news from Turkey, which he read in
yesterday's mail,&mdash;"Now Turkey by this time looks
determined, and Lord Palmerston"&mdash;Why, I would
rather talk of the bran, which, unfortunately, was sifted
out of my bread this morning, and thrown away. It is
a fact which lies nearer to me. The newspaper gossip
with which our hosts abuse our ears is as far from a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
true hospitality as the viands which they set before us.
We did not need them to feed our bodies, and the
news can be bought for a penny. We want the inevitable
news, be it sad or cheering, wherefore and by what
means they are extant this <i>new</i> day. If they are well,
let them whistle and dance; if they are dyspeptic, it is
their duty to complain, that so they may in any case
be <i>entertaining</i>. If words were invented to conceal
thought, I think that newspapers are a great improvement
on a bad invention. Do not suffer your life to be
taken by newspapers.</p>

<p>I thank you for your hearty appreciation of my book.
I am glad to have had such a long talk with you, and
that you had patience to listen to me to the end. I
think that I had the advantage of you, for I chose my
own mood, and in one sense your mood too,&mdash;that is,
a quiet and attentive reading mood. Such advantage
has the writer over the talker. I am sorry that you did
not come to Concord in your vacation. Is it not time
for another vacation? I am here yet, and Concord is
here.</p>

<p>You will have found out by this time who it is that
writes this, and will be glad to have you write to him,
without his subscribing himself</p>

<p class="left65">
<span class="smcap">Henry D. Thoreau</span>.</p>

<p>P. S.&mdash;It is so long since I have seen you, that, as
you will perceive, I have to speak, as it were, <i>in vacuo</i>,
as if I were sounding hollowly for an echo, and it did
not make much odds what kind of a sound I made.
But the gods do not hear any rude or discordant sound,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
as we learn from the echo; and I know that the nature
toward which I launch these sounds is so rich that it
will modulate anew and wonderfully improve my rudest
strain.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT MILTON).</p>

<p class="address"><span class="smcap">Concord</span>, April 3, 1850.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Blake</span>,&mdash;I thank you for your letter, and I
will endeavor to record some of the thoughts which it
suggests, whether pertinent or not. You speak of poverty
and dependence. Who are poor and dependent?
Who are rich and independent? When was it that
men agreed to respect the appearance and not the
reality? Why should the appearance <i>appear</i>? Are we
well acquainted, then, with the reality? There is none
who does not lie hourly in the respect he pays to false
appearance. How sweet it would be to treat men and
things, for an hour, for just what they are! We wonder
that the sinner does not confess his sin. When we are
weary with travel, we lay down our load and rest by
the wayside. So, when we are weary with the burden
of life, why do we not lay down this load of falsehoods
which we have volunteered to sustain, and be refreshed
as never mortal was? Let the beautiful laws prevail.
Let us not weary ourselves by resisting them. When
we would rest our bodies we cease to support them;
we recline on the lap of earth. So, when we would
rest our spirits, we must recline on the Great Spirit.
Let things alone; let them weigh what they will; let
them soar or fall. To succeed in letting only one thing
alone in a winter morning, if it be only one poor frozen-thawed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
apple that hangs on a tree, what a glorious
achievement! Methinks it lightens through the dusky
universe. What an infinite wealth we have discovered!
God reigns, <i>i. e.</i>, when we take a liberal view,&mdash;when
a liberal view is presented us.</p>

<p>Let God alone if need be. Methinks, if I loved him
more, I should keep him&mdash;I should keep myself
rather&mdash;at a more respectful distance. It is not when
I am going to meet him, but when I am just turning
away and leaving him alone, that I discover that God
is. I say, God. I am not sure that that is the name.
You will know whom I mean.</p>

<p>If for a moment we make way with our petty selves,
wish no ill to anything, apprehend no ill, cease to be
but as the crystal which reflects a ray,&mdash;what shall we
not reflect! What a universe will appear crystallized
and radiant around us!</p>

<p>I should say, let the Muse lead the Muse,&mdash;let the
understanding lead the understanding, though in any
case it is the farthest forward which leads them both.
If the Muse accompany, she is no muse, but an amusement.
The Muse should lead like a star which is very
far off; but that does not imply that we are to follow
foolishly, falling into sloughs and over precipices, for
it is not foolishness, but understanding, which is to
follow, which the Muse is appointed to lead, as a fit
guide of a fit follower?</p>

<p>Will you live? or will you be embalmed? Will you
live, though it be astride of a sunbeam; or will you
repose safely in the catacombs for a thousand years?
In the former case, the worst accident that can happen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
is that you may break your neck. Will you break your
heart, your soul, to save your neck? Necks and pipe-stems
are fated to be broken. Men make a great ado
about the folly of demanding too much of life (or of
eternity?), and of endeavoring to live according to that
demand. It is much ado about nothing. No harm
ever came from that quarter. I am not afraid that I
shall exaggerate the value and significance of life, but
that I shall not be up to the occasion which it is. I
shall be sorry to remember that I was there, but noticed
nothing remarkable,&mdash;not so much as a prince in disguise;
lived in the golden age a hired man; visited
Olympus even, but fell asleep after dinner, and did
not hear the conversation of the gods. I lived in Judæa
eighteen hundred years ago, but I never knew that there
was such a one as Christ among my contemporaries!
If there is anything more glorious than a congress of
men a-framing or amending of a constitution going on,
which I suspect there is, I desire to see the morning
papers. I am greedy of the faintest rumor, though it
were got by listening at the keyhole. I will dissipate
myself in that direction.</p>

<p>I am glad to know that you find what I have said on
Friendship worthy of attention. I wish that I could
have the benefit of your criticism; it would be a rare
help to me. Will you not communicate it?</p>

<p class="center p2">TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT MILTON).</p>

<p class="address"><span class="smcap">Concord</span>, May 28, 1850.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Blake</span>,&mdash;"I never found any contentment in
the life which the newspapers record,"&mdash;anything of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
more value than the cent which they cost. Contentment
in being covered with dust an inch deep! We
who walk the streets, and hold time together, are but
the refuse of ourselves, and that life is for the shells of
us,&mdash;of our body and our mind,&mdash;for our scurf,&mdash;a
thoroughly <i>scurvy</i> life. It is coffee made of coffee-grounds
the twentieth time, which was only coffee the
first time,&mdash;while the living water leaps and sparkles
by our doors. I know some who, in their charity, give
their coffee-grounds to the poor! We, demanding news,
and putting up with <i>such</i> news! Is it a new convenience,
or a new accident, or, rather, a new perception of the
truth that we want!</p>

<p>You say that "the serene hours in which friendship,
books, nature, thought, seem alone primary considerations,
visit you but faintly." Is not the attitude of
expectation somewhat divine?&mdash;a sort of home-made
divineness? Does it not compel a kind of sphere-music
to attend on it? And do not its satisfactions merge at
length, by insensible degrees, in the enjoyment of the
thing expected?</p>

<p>What if I should forget to write about my not writing?
It is not worth the while to make that a theme.
It is as if I had written every day. It is as if I had
never written before. I wonder that you think so much
about it, for not writing is the most like writing, in my
case, of anything I know.</p>

<p>Why will you not relate to me your dream? That
would be to realize it somewhat. You tell me that you
dream, but not what you dream. I can <i>guess</i> what
comes to pass. So do the frogs dream. Would that I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
knew what. I have never found out whether they are
awake or asleep,&mdash;whether it is day or night with
them.</p>

<p>I am preaching, mind you, to bare walls, that is, to
myself; and if you have chanced to come in and occupy
a pew, do not think that my remarks are directed at
you particularly, and so slam the seat in disgust. This
discourse was written long before these exciting times.</p>

<p>Some absorbing employment on your higher ground,&mdash;your
upland farm,&mdash;whither no cart-path leads, but
where you mount alone with your hoe,&mdash;where the life
everlasting grows; there you raise a crop which needs
not to be brought down into the valley to a market;
which you barter for heavenly products.</p>

<p>Do you separate distinctly enough the support of
your body from that of your essence? By how distinct
a course commonly are these two ends attained! Not
that they should not be attained by one and the same
means,&mdash;that, indeed, is the rarest success,&mdash;but there
is no half and half about it.</p>

<p>I shall be glad to read my lecture to a small audience
in Worcester such as you describe, and will only require
that my expenses be paid. If only the parlor be large
enough for an echo, and the audience will embarrass
themselves with hearing as much as the lecturer would
otherwise embarrass himself with reading. But I warn
you that this is no better calculated for a promiscuous
audience than the last two which I read to you. It requires,
in every sense, a concordant audience.</p>

<p>I will come on next Saturday and spend Sunday with
you if you wish it. Say so if you do.

<p>"Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring."</p>

<p>Be not deterred by melancholy on the path which
leads to immortal health and joy. When they tasted of
the water of the river over which they were to go, they
thought it tasted a little bitterish to the palate, but it
proved sweeter when it was down.</p>

<span class="smcap">Note</span>.&mdash;The "companion" of his walks, mentioned by Thoreau
in November, 1849, was Ellery Channing; the neighbor who insisted
on talking of Turkey was perhaps Emerson, who, after his visit to
Europe in 1848, was more interested in its politics than before. Pencil-making
was Thoreau's manual work for many years; and it must
have been about this time (1849-53) that he "had occasion to go to
New York to peddle some pencils," as he says in his journal for November
20, 1853. He adds, "I was obliged to manufacture one thousand
dollars' worth of pencils, and slowly dispose of, and finally sacrifice
them, in order to pay an assumed debt of one hundred dollars."
This debt was for the printing of the <i>Week</i>, published in 1849, and
finally paid for in 1855. Thoreau's pencils have sold (in 1893) for 25
cents each. For other facts concerning his debt to James Munroe,
see Sanborn's <i>Thoreau</i>, pp. 230, 235.</p>

<h2>III<br />
FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS</h2>

<p class="center p2">TO R. W. EMERSON<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
 (AT CONCORD).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Fire Island Beach</span>,
Thursday morning, July 25, 1850.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;I am writing this at the house of
Smith Oakes, within one mile of the wreck. He is the
one who rendered most assistance, William H. Channing
came down with me, but I have not seen Arthur
Fuller, nor Greeley, nor Marcus Spring. Spring and
Charles Sumner were here yesterday, but left soon.
Mr. Oakes and wife tell me (all the survivors came, or
were brought, directly to their house) that the ship
struck at ten minutes after four <span class="smcap">A. M.</span>, and all hands,
being mostly in their nightclothes, made haste to the
forecastle, the water coming in at once. There they
remained; the passengers <i>in</i> the forecastle, the crew
above it, doing what they could. Every wave lifted the
forecastle roof and washed over those within. The first
man got ashore at nine; many from nine to noon. At
flood-tide, about half past three o'clock, when the ship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
broke up entirely, they came out of the forecastle, and
Margaret sat with her back to the foremast, with her
hands on her knees, her husband and child already
drowned. A great wave came and washed her aft.
The steward (?) had just before taken her child and
started for shore. Both were drowned.</p>

<p>The broken desk, in a bag, containing no very valuable
papers; a large black leather trunk, with an upper
and under compartment, the upper holding books and
papers; a carpetbag, probably Ossoli's, and one of
his shoes (?) are all the Ossoli effects known to have
been found. Four bodies remain to be found: the two
Ossolis, Horace Sumner, and a sailor. I have visited
the child's grave. Its body will probably be taken
away to-day. The wreck is to be sold at auction, excepting
the hull, to-day.</p>

<p>The mortar would not go off. Mrs. Hasty, the captain's
wife, told Mrs. Oakes that she and Margaret
divided their money, and tied up the halves in handkerchiefs
around their persons; that Margaret took sixty
or seventy dollars. Mrs. Hasty, who can tell all about
Margaret up to eleven o'clock on Friday, is said to be
going to Portland, New England, to-day. She and
Mrs. Fuller must, and probably will, come together.
The cook, the last to leave, and the steward (?) will
know the rest. I shall try to see them. In the meanwhile
I shall do what I can to recover property and
obtain particulars hereabouts. William H. Channing&mdash;did
I write it?&mdash;has come with me. Arthur Fuller<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
has this moment reached the house. He reached the
beach last night. We got here yesterday noon. A good
part of the wreck still holds together where she struck,
and something may come ashore with her fragments.
The last body was found on Tuesday, three miles
west. Mrs. Oakes dried the papers which were in the
trunk, and she says they appeared to be of various
kinds. "Would they cover that table?" (a small round
one). "They would if spread out. Some were tied up."
There were twenty or thirty books "in the same half
of the trunk. Another smaller trunk, empty, came
ashore, but there was no mark on it." She speaks of
Paulina as if she might have been a sort of nurse to
the child. I expect to go to Patchogue, whence the pilferers
must have chiefly come, and advertise, etc.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO HARRISON BLAKE (IN MILTON).</p>

<p class="address"><span class="smcap">Concord</span> August 9, 1850.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Blake</span>,&mdash;I received your letter just as I was
rushing to Fire Island beach to recover what remained
of Margaret Fuller, and read it on the way. That event
and its train, as much as anything, have prevented my
answering it before. It is wisest to speak when you are
spoken to. I will now endeavor to reply, at the risk of
having nothing to say.</p>

<p>I find that actual events, notwithstanding the singular
prominence which we all allow them, are far less real
than the creations of my imagination. They are truly
visionary and insignificant,&mdash;all that we commonly
call life and death,&mdash;and affect me less than my dreams.
This petty stream which from time to time swells and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
carries away the mills and bridges of our habitual life,
and that mightier stream or ocean on which we securely
float,&mdash;what makes the difference between them? I
have in my pocket a button which I ripped off the coat
of the Marquis of Ossoli, on the seashore, the other
day. Held up, it intercepts the light,&mdash;an actual button,&mdash;and
yet all the life it is connected with is less
substantial to me, and interests me less, than my faintest
dream. Our thoughts are the epochs in our lives: all
else is but as a journal of the winds that blew while we
were here.</p>

<p>I say to myself, Do a little more of that work which
you have confessed to be good. You are neither satisfied
nor dissatisfied with yourself, without reason. Have
you not a thinking faculty of inestimable value? If
there is an experiment which you would like to try, try it.
Do not entertain doubts if they are not agreeable to
you. Remember that you need not eat unless you are
hungry. Do not read the newspapers. Improve every
opportunity to be melancholy. As for health, consider
yourself well. Do not engage to find things as you
think they are. Do what nobody else can do for you.
Omit to do anything else. It is not easy to make our
lives respectable by any course of activity. We must
repeatedly withdraw into our shells of thought, like the
tortoise, somewhat helplessly; yet there is more than
philosophy in that.</p>

<p>Do not waste any reverence on my attitude. I merely
manage to sit up where I have dropped. I am sure that
my acquaintances mistake me. They ask my advice
on high matters, but they do not know even how poorly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
on 't I am for hats and shoes. I have hardly a shift.
Just as shabby as I am in my outward apparel, ay, and
more lamentably shabby, am I in my inward substance.
If I should turn myself inside out, my rags and meanness
would indeed appear. I am something to him that
made me, undoubtedly, but not much to any other that
he has made.</p>

<p>Would it not be worth while to discover nature in
Milton? be native to the universe? I, too, love Concord
best, but I am glad when I discover, in oceans
and wildernesses far away, the material of a million
Concords: indeed, I am lost, unless I discover them.
I see less difference between a city and a swamp than
formerly. It is a swamp, however, too dismal and
dreary even for me, and I should be glad if there were
fewer owls, and frogs, and mosquitoes in it. I prefer
ever a more cultivated place, free from miasma and
crocodiles. I am so sophisticated, and I will take my
choice.</p>

<p>As for missing friends,&mdash;what if we do miss one
another? have we not agreed on a rendezvous? While
each wanders his own way through the wood, without
anxiety, ay, with serene joy, though it be on his hands
and knees, over rocks and fallen trees, he cannot but
be in the right way. There is no wrong way to him.
How can he be said to miss his friend, whom the fruits
still nourish and the elements sustain? A man who
missed his friend at a turn, went on buoyantly, dividing
the friendly air, and humming a tune to himself,
ever and anon kneeling with delight to study each little
lichen in his path, and scarcely made three miles a day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
for friendship. As for conforming outwardly, and living
your own life inwardly, I do not think much of that.
Let not your right hand know what your left hand does
in that line of business. It will prove a failure. Just
as successfully can you walk against a sharp steel edge
which divides you cleanly right and left. Do you wish
to try your ability to resist distension? It is a greater
strain than any soul can long endure. When you get
God to pulling one way, and the devil the other, each
having his feet well braced,&mdash;to say nothing of the
conscience sawing transversely,&mdash;almost any timber
will give way.</p>

<p>I do not dare invite you earnestly to come to Concord,
because I know too well that the berries are not
thick in my fields, and we should have to take it out
in viewing the landscape. But come, on every account,
and we will see&mdash;one another.</p>

<p class="p2">No letters of the year 1851 have been found by me.
On the 27th of December, 1850, Mr. Cabot wrote to
say that the Boston Society of Natural History, of which
he was secretary, had elected Thoreau a corresponding
member, "with all the <i>honores</i>, <i>privilegia</i>, <i>etc.</i>, <i>ad gradum
tuum pertinentia</i>, without the formality of paying
any entrance fee, or annual subscription. Your duties
in return are to advance the interests of the Society by
communications or otherwise, as shall seem good."
This is believed to be the only learned body which
honored itself by electing Thoreau. The immediate
occasion of this election was the present, by Thoreau,
to the Society, of a fine specimen of the American goshawk,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
caught or shot by Jacob Farmer, which Mr.
Cabot acknowledged, December 18, 1849, saying: "It
was first described by Wilson; lately Audubon has
identified it with the European goshawk, thereby committing
a very flagrant blunder. It is usually a very
rare species with us. The European bird is used in
hawking; and doubtless ours would be equally <i>game</i>.
If Mr. Farmer skins him now, he will have to take second
cut; for his skin is already off and stuffed,&mdash;his
remains dissected, measured, and deposited in alcohol."</p>

<p class="center p2">TO T. W. HIGGINSON (AT BOSTON).</p>

<p class="address"><span class="smcap">Concord</span>, April 2-3, 1852.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I do not see that I can refuse to read
another lecture, but what makes me hesitate is the fear
that I have not another available which will <i>entertain</i>
a large audience, though I have thoughts to offer which
I think will be quite as worthy of their attention. However,
I will try; for the prospect of earning a few dollars
is alluring. As far as I can foresee, my subject
would be "Reality" rather transcendentally treated.
It lies still in "Walden, or Life in the Woods." Since
you are kind enough to undertake the arrangements, I
will leave it to you to name an evening of next week,
decide on the most suitable room, and advertise,&mdash;if
this is not taking you too literally at your word.</p>

<p>If you still think it worth the while to attend to this,
will you let me know as soon as may be what evening
will be most convenient? I certainly do not feel
prepared to offer myself as a lecturer to the Boston
<i>public</i>, and hardly know whether more to dread a small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
audience or a large one. Nevertheless, I will repress this
squeamishness, and propose no alteration in your arrangements.
I shall be glad to accept your invitation
to tea.</p>

<p class="p2">This lecture was given, says Colonel Higginson, "at
the Mechanics' Apprentices Library in Boston, with
the snow outside, and the young boys rustling their
newspapers among the Alcotts and Blakes." Or, possibly,
this remark may apply to a former lecture in the
same year, which was that in which Thoreau first lectured
habitually away from Concord. He commenced
by accepting an invitation to speak at Leyden Hall, in
Plymouth, where his friends the Watsons had organized
Sunday services, that the Transcendentalists and
Abolitionists might have a chance to be heard at a time
when they were generally excluded from the popular
"Lyceum courses" throughout New England. Mr.
B. M. Watson says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have found two letters from Thoreau in answer
to my invitation in 1852 to address our congregation at
Leyden Hall on Sunday mornings,&mdash;an enterprise I
undertook about that time. I find among the distinguished
men who addressed us the names of Thoreau,
Emerson, Ellery Channing, Alcott, Higginson, Remond,
S. Johnson, F. J. Appleton, Edmund Quincy, Garrison,
Phillips, J. P. Lesley, Shackford, W. F. Channing,
N. H. Whiting, Adin Ballou, Abby K. Foster and her
husband, J. T. Sargent, T. T. Stone, Jones Very,
Wasson, Hurlbut, F. W. Holland, and Scherb; so you
may depend we had some fun."

<p>These letters were mere notes. The first, dated February
17, 1852, says: "I have not yet seen Mr. Channing,
though I believe he is in town,&mdash;having decided
to come to Plymouth myself,&mdash;but I will let him know
that he is expected. Mr. Daniel Foster wishes me to
say that he accepts your invitation, and that he would
like to come Sunday after next. I will take the Saturday
afternoon train. I shall be glad to get a winter
view of Plymouth Harbor, and see where your garden
lies under the snow."</p>

<p>The second letter follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center p2">TO MARSTON WATSON (AT PLYMOUTH).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, December 31, 1852.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Watson</span>,&mdash;I would be glad to visit Plymouth
again, but at present I have nothing to read which is
not severely heathenish, or at least secular,&mdash;which
the dictionary defines as "relating to affairs of the
present world, not holy,"&mdash;though not necessarily unholy;
nor have I any leisure to prepare it. My writing
at present is profane, yet in a good sense, and, as it
were, sacredly, I may say; for, finding the air of the
temple too close, I sat outside. Don't think I say this
to get off; no, no! It will not do to read such things to
hungry ears. "If they ask for bread, will you give
them a stone?" When I have something of the right
kind, depend upon it I will let you know.</p>

<p class="p2">Up to 1848, when he was invited to lecture before
the Salem Lyceum by Nathaniel Hawthorne, then its
secretary, Thoreau seems to have spoken publicly very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
little except in Concord; nor did he extend the circuit
of his lectures much until his two books had made him
known as a thinker. There was little to attract a popular
audience in his manner or his matter; but it was
the era of lectures, and if one could once gain admission
to the circle of "lyceum lecturers," it did not so
much matter what he said; a lecture was a lecture, as
a sermon was a sermon, good, bad, or indifferent. But
it was common to exclude the antislavery speakers
from the lyceums, even those of more eloquence than
Thoreau; this led to invitations from the small band
of reformers scattered about New England and New
York, so that the most unlikely of platform speakers
(Ellery Channing, for example) sometimes gave lectures
at Plymouth, Greenfield, Newburyport, or elsewhere.
The present fashion of parlor lectures had not
come in; yet at Worcester Thoreau's friends early organized
for him something of that kind, as his letters
to Mr. Blake show. In default of an audience of numbers,
Thoreau fell into the habit of lecturing in his
letters to this friend; the most marked instance being
the thoughtful essay on Love and Chastity which
makes the bulk of his epistle dated September, 1852.
Like most of his serious writing, this was made up
from his daily journal, and hardly comes under the
head of "familiar letters;" the didactic purpose is
rather too apparent. Yet it cannot be spared from any
collection of his epistles,&mdash;none of which flowed more
directly from the quickened moral nature of the man.

<p class="center p2">TO SOPHIA THOREAU (AT BANGOR).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, July 13, 1852.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sophia</span>,&mdash;I am a miserable letter-writer, but
perhaps if I should say this at length and with sufficient
emphasis and regret it would make a letter. I am
sorry that nothing transpires here of much moment; or,
I should rather say, that I am so slackened and rusty,
like the telegraph wire this season, that no wind that
blows can extract music from me.</p>

<p>I am not on the trail of any elephants or mastodons,
but have succeeded in trapping only a few ridiculous
mice, which cannot feed my imagination. I have become
sadly scientific. I would rather come upon the
vast valley-like "spoor" only of some celestial beast
which this world's woods can no longer sustain, than
spring my net over a bushel of moles. You must do
better in those woods where you are. You must have
some adventures to relate and repeat for years to come,
which will eclipse even mother's voyage to Goldsborough
and Sissiboo.</p>

<p>They say that Mr. Pierce, the presidential candidate,
was in town last 5th of July, visiting Hawthorne, whose
college chum he was; and that Hawthorne is writing a
life of him, for electioneering purposes.</p>

<p>Concord is just as idiotic as ever in relation to the
spirits and their knockings. Most people here believe
in a spiritual world which no respectable junk bottle,
which had not met with a slip, would condescend to
contain even a portion of for a moment,&mdash;whose atmosphere
would extinguish a candle let down into it, like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
a well that wants airing; in spirits which the very bullfrogs
in our meadows would blackball. Their evil genius
is seeing how low it can degrade them. The hooting
of owls, the croaking of frogs, is celestial wisdom
in comparison. If I could be brought to believe in the
things which they believe, I should make haste to get
rid of my certificate of stock in this and the next world's
enterprises, and buy a share in the first Immediate
Annihilation Company that offered. I would exchange
my immortality for a glass of small beer this hot
weather. Where <i>are</i> the heathen? Was there ever any
superstition before? And yet I suppose there may be a
vessel this very moment setting sail from the coast of
North America to that of Africa with a missionary on
board! Consider the dawn and the sunrise,&mdash;the rainbow
and the evening,&mdash;the words of Christ and the
aspiration of all the saints! Hear music! see, smell,
taste, feel, hear,&mdash;anything,&mdash;and then hear these
idiots, inspired by the cracking of a restless board,
humbly asking, "Please, Spirit, if you cannot answer
by knocks, answer by tips of the table." ! ! ! ! ! ! !</p>

<p class="center p2">TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER).</p>

<p class="address"><span class="smcap">Concord</span>, July 21, 1852.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Blake</span>,&mdash;I am too stupidly well these days to
write to you. My life is almost altogether outward,&mdash;all
shell and no tender kernel; so that I fear the report
of it would be only a nut for you to crack, with no
meat in it for you to eat. Moreover, you have not
cornered me up, and I enjoy such large liberty in writing
to you, that I feel as vague as the air. However, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
rejoice to hear that you have attended so patiently to
anything which I have said heretofore, and have detected
any truth in it. It encourages me to say more,&mdash;not
in this letter, I fear, but in some book which
I may write one day. I am glad to know that I am as
much to any mortal as a persistent and consistent scarecrow
is to a farmer,&mdash;such a bundle of straw in a
man's clothing as I am, with a few bits of tin to sparkle
in the sun dangling about me, as if I were hard at work
there in the field. However, if this kind of life saves
any man's corn,&mdash;why, he is the gainer. I am not
afraid that you will flatter me as long as you know
what I am, as well as what I think, or aim to be, and
distinguish between these two, for then it will commonly
happen that if you praise the last you will condemn
the first.</p>

<p>I remember that walk to Asnebumskit very well,&mdash;a
fit place to go to on a Sunday; one of the true temples
of the earth. A temple, you know, was anciently "an
open place without a roof," whose walls served merely
to shut out the world and direct the mind toward
heaven; but a modern <i>meeting-house</i> shuts out the
heavens, while it crowds the world into still closer quarters.
Best of all is it when, as on a mountain-top, you
have for all walls your own elevation and deeps of surrounding
ether. The partridge-berries, watered with
mountain dews which are gathered there, are more
memorable to me than the words which I last heard
from the pulpit at least; and for my part, I would rather
look toward Rutland than Jerusalem. Rutland,&mdash;modern
town,&mdash;land of ruts,&mdash;trivial and worn,&mdash;not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
too sacred,&mdash;with no holy sepulchre, but profane
green fields and dusty roads, and opportunity to live
as holy a life as you can,&mdash;where the sacredness, if
there is any, is all in yourself and not in the place.</p>

<p>I fear that your Worcester people do not often
enough go to the hilltops, though, as I am told, the
springs lie nearer to the surface on your hills than in your
valleys. They have the reputation of being Free-Soilers.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>

Do they insist on a free atmosphere, too, that is,
on freedom for the head or brain as well as the feet?
If I were consciously to join any party, it would be
that which is the most free to entertain thought.</p>

<p>All the world complain nowadays of a press of trivial
duties and engagements, which prevents their employing
themselves on some higher ground they know of;
but, undoubtedly, if they were made of the right stuff
to work on that higher ground, provided they were released
from all those engagements, they would now at
once fulfill the superior engagement, and neglect all the
rest, as naturally as they breathe. They would never
be caught saying that they had no time for this, when
the dullest man knows that this is all that he has time
for. No man who acts from a sense of duty ever puts
the lesser duty above the greater. No man has the
desire and the ability to work on high things, but he
has also the ability to build himself a high staging.</p>

<p>As for passing <i>through</i> any great and glorious experience,
and rising <i>above</i> it, as an eagle might fly athwart
the evening sky to rise into still brighter and fairer regions
of the heavens, I cannot say that I ever sailed so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
creditably; but my bark ever seemed thwarted by some
side wind, and went off over the edge, and now only
occasionally tacks back toward the centre of that sea
again. I have outgrown nothing good, but, I do not
fear to say, fallen behind by whole continents of virtue,
which should have been passed as islands in my course;
but I trust&mdash;what else can I trust? that, with a stiff
wind, some Friday, when I have thrown some of my
cargo overboard, I may make up for all that distance
lost.</p>

<p>Perchance the time will come when we shall not be
content to go back and forth upon a raft to some
huge Homeric or Shakespearean Indiaman that lies
upon the reef, but build a bark out of that wreck and
others that are buried in the sands of this desolate
island, and such new timber as may be required, in
which to sail away to whole new worlds of light and
life, where our friends are.</p>

<p>Write again. There is one respect in which you did
not finish your letter: you did not write it with ink, and
it is not so good, therefore, against or for you in the
eye of the law, nor in the eye of</p>

H. D. T.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER).</p>

<p class="address">
September, 1852.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Blake</span>,&mdash;Here come the sentences which I
promised you. You may keep them, if you will regard
and use them as the disconnected fragments of what I
may find to be a completer essay, on looking over my
journal, at last, and may claim again.</p>

<p>I send you the thoughts on Chastity and Sensuality
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
with diffidence and shame, not knowing how far I
speak to the condition of men generally, or how far
I betray my peculiar defects. Pray enlighten me on
this point if you can.</p>

<p class="center">
LOVE.</p>

<p>What the essential difference between man and
woman is, that they should be thus attracted to one
another, no one has satisfactorily answered. Perhaps
we must acknowledge the justness of the distinction
which assigns to man the sphere of wisdom, and to
woman that of love, though neither belongs exclusively
to either. Man is continually saying to woman, Why
will you not be more wise? Woman is continually saying
to man, Why will you not be more loving? It is
not in their wills to be wise or to be loving; but, unless
each is both wise and loving, there can be neither
wisdom nor love.</p>

<p>All transcendent goodness is one, though appreciated
in different ways, or by different senses. In beauty we
see it, in music we hear it, in fragrance we scent it, in
the palatable the pure palate tastes it, and in rare
health the whole body feels it. The variety is in the
surface or manifestation; but the radical identity we
fail to express. The lover sees in the glance of his
beloved the same beauty that in the sunset paints the
western skies. It is the same daimon, here lurking under
a human eyelid, and there under the closing eyelids of
the day. Here, in small compass, is the ancient and
natural beauty of evening and morning. What loving
astronomer has ever fathomed the ethereal depths of
the eye?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span></p>

<p>The maiden conceals a fairer flower and sweeter
fruit than any calyx in the field; and, if she goes with
averted face, confiding in her purity and high resolves,
she will make the heavens retrospective, and all nature
humbly confess its queen.</p>

<p>Under the influence of this sentiment, man is a
string of an æolian harp, which vibrates with the
zephyrs of the eternal morning.</p>

<p>There is at first thought something trivial in the
commonness of love. So many Indian youths and
maidens along these banks have in ages past yielded
to the influence of this great civilizer. Nevertheless,
this generation is not disgusted nor discouraged, for
love is no individual's experience; and though we are
imperfect mediums, it does not partake of our imperfection;
though we are finite, it is infinite and eternal;
and the same divine influence broods over these banks,
whatever race may inhabit them, and perchance still
would, even if the human race did not dwell here.</p>

<p>Perhaps an instinct survives through the intensest
actual love, which prevents entire abandonment and
devotion, and makes the most ardent lover a little
reserved. It is the anticipation of change. For the
most ardent lover is not the less practically wise, and
seeks a love which will last forever.</p>

<p>Considering how few poetical friendships there are,
it is remarkable that so many are married. It would
seem as if men yielded too easy an obedience to nature
without consulting their genius. One may be drunk
with love without being any nearer to finding his mate.
There is more of good nature than of good sense at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
the bottom of most marriages. But the good nature
must have the counsel of the good spirit or Intelligence.
If common sense had been consulted, how
many marriages would never have taken place; if uncommon
or divine sense, how few marriages such as
we witness would ever have taken place!</p>

<p>Our love may be ascending or descending. What is
its character, if it may be said of it,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><p class="o1">
"We must <i>respect</i> the souls above,</p>
<p>But only <i>those below we love</i>."</p></div></div>

<p>Love is a severe critic. Hate can pardon more than
love. They who aspire to love worthily, subject themselves
to an ordeal more rigid than any other.</p>

<p>Is your friend such a one that an increase of worth
on your part will surely make her more your friend?
Is she retained&mdash;is she attracted by more nobleness in
you,&mdash;by more of that virtue which is peculiarly yours;
or is she indifferent and blind to that? Is she to be
flattered and won by your meeting her on any other
than the ascending path? Then duty requires that you
separate from her.</p>

<p>Love must be as much a light as a flame.</p>

<p>Where there is not discernment, the behavior even
of the purest soul may in effect amount to coarseness.</p>

<p>A man of fine perceptions is more truly feminine
than a merely sentimental woman. The heart is blind;
but love is not blind. None of the gods is so discriminating.</p>

<p>In love and friendship the imagination is as much
exercised as the heart; and if either is outraged the
other will be estranged. It is commonly the imagination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
which is wounded first, rather than the heart,&mdash;it
is so much the more sensitive.</p>

<p><i>Comparatively</i>, we can excuse any offense against the
heart, but not against the imagination. The imagination
knows&mdash;nothing escapes its glance from out its
eyry&mdash;and it controls the breast. My heart may still
yearn toward the valley, but my imagination will not
permit me to jump off the precipice that debars me
from it, for it is wounded, its wings are clipt, and it
cannot fly, even descendingly. Our "blundering
hearts!" some poet says. The imagination never forgets;
it is a re-membering. It is not foundationless,
but most reasonable, and it alone uses all the knowledge
of the intellect.</p>

<p>Love is the profoundest of secrets. Divulged, even to
the beloved, it is no longer Love. As if it were merely
I that loved you. When love ceases, then it is divulged.</p>

<p>In our intercourse with one we love, we wish to have
answered those questions at the end of which we do
not raise our voice; against which we put no interrogation-mark,&mdash;answered
with the same unfailing, universal
aim toward every point of the compass.</p>

<p>I require that thou knowest everything without being
told anything. I parted from my beloved because there
was one thing which I had to tell her. She <i>questioned</i>
me. She should have known all by sympathy. That I
had to tell it her was the difference between us,&mdash;the
misunderstanding.</p>

<p>A lover never hears anything that he is <i>told</i>, for that
is commonly either false or stale; but he hears things
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
taking place, as the sentinels heard Trenck<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
 mining
in the ground, and thought it was moles.</p>

<p>The relation may be profaned in many ways. The
parties may not regard it with equal sacredness. What
if the lover should learn that his beloved dealt in incantations
and philters! What if he should hear that
she consulted a clairvoyant! The spell would be instantly
broken.</p>

<p>If to chaffer and higgle are bad in trade, they are
much worse in Love. It demands directness as of an
arrow.</p>

<p>There is danger that we lose sight of what our friend
is absolutely, while considering what she is to us alone.</p>

<p>The lover wants no partiality. He says, Be so kind
as to be just.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><p>Canst thou love with thy mind,</p>
<p class="i1">And reason with thy heart?</p>
<p>Canst thou be kind,</p>
<p class="i1">And from thy darling part?</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Canst thou range earth, sea, and air,</p>
<p>And so meet me everywhere?</p>
<p>Through all events I will pursue thee,</p>
<p>Through all persons I will woo thee.</p></div></div></div>

<p>I need thy hate as much as thy love. Thou wilt not
repel me entirely when thou repellest what is evil
in me.</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Indeed, indeed, I cannot tell,</p>
<p>Though I ponder on it well,</p>
<p>Which were easier to state,</p>
<p>All my love or all my hate.</p>
<p>Surely, surely, thou wilt trust me</p>
<p>When I say thou doth disgust me.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span></p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>O, I hate thee with a hate</p>
<p>That would fain annihilate;</p>
<p>Yet, sometimes, against my will,</p>
<p>My dear Friend, I love thee still.</p>
<p>It were treason to our love,</p>
<p>And a sin to God above,</p>
<p>One iota to abate</p>
<p>Of a pure, impartial hate.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is not enough that we are truthful; we must cherish
and carry out high purposes to be truthful about.</p>

<p>It must be rare, indeed, that we meet with one to
whom we are prepared to be quite ideally related, as
she to us. We should have no reserve; we should give
the whole of ourselves to that society; we should have
no duty aside from that. One who could bear to be so
wonderfully and beautifully exaggerated every day. I
would take my friend out of her low self and set her
higher, infinitely higher, and <i>there</i> know her. But,
commonly, men are as much afraid of love as of hate.
They have lower engagements. They have near ends
to serve. They have not imagination enough to be thus
employed about a human being, but must be coopering
a barrel, forsooth.</p>

<p>What a difference, whether, in all your walks, you
meet only strangers, or in one house is one who knows
you, and whom you know. To have a brother or a
sister! To have a gold mine on your farm! To find
diamonds in the gravel heaps before your door! How
rare these things are! To share the day with you,&mdash;to
people the earth. Whether to have a god or a goddess
for companion in your walks, or to walk alone with
hinds and villains and carles. Would not a friend enhance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
the beauty of the landscape as much as a deer or
hare? Everything would acknowledge and serve such a
relation; the corn in the field, and the cranberries in
the meadow. The flowers would bloom, and the birds
sing, with a new impulse. There would be more fair
days in the year.</p>

<p>The object of love expands and grows before us
to eternity, until it includes all that is lovely, and we
become all that can love.</p>

<p class="center p2">CHASTITY AND SENSUALITY.</p>

<p>The subject of sex is a remarkable one, since, though
its phenomena concern us so much, both directly and
indirectly, and, sooner or later, it occupies the thoughts
of all, yet all mankind, as it were, agree to be silent
about it, at least the sexes commonly one to another.
One of the most interesting of all human facts is veiled
more completely than any mystery. It is treated with
such secrecy and awe as surely do not go to any religion.
I believe that it is unusual even for the most
intimate friends to communicate the pleasures and anxieties
connected with this fact,&mdash;much as the external
affair of love, its comings and goings, are bruited. The
Shakers do not exaggerate it so much by their manner
of speaking of it as all mankind by their manner of
keeping silence about it. Not that men should speak
on this or any subject without having anything worthy
to say; but it is plain that the education of man has
hardly commenced,&mdash;there is so little genuine intercommunication.</p>

<p>In a pure society, the subject of marriage would not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
be so often avoided,&mdash;from shame and not from reverence,
winked out of sight, and hinted at only; but
treated naturally and simply,&mdash;perhaps simply avoided,
like the kindred mysteries. If it cannot be spoken of
for shame, how can it be acted of? But, doubtless,
there is far more purity, as well as more impurity, than
is apparent.</p>

<p>Men commonly couple with their idea of marriage a
slight degree at least of sensuality; but every lover, the
world over, believes in its inconceivable purity.</p>

<p>If it is the result of a pure love, there can be nothing
sensual in marriage. Chastity is something positive,
not negative. It is the virtue of the married especially.
All lusts or base pleasures must give place to loftier
delights. They who meet as superior beings cannot
perform the deeds of inferior ones. The deeds of love
are less questionable than any action of an individual
can be, for, it being founded on the rarest mutual
respect, the parties incessantly stimulate each other to
a loftier and purer life, and the act in which they are
associated must be pure and noble indeed, for innocence
and purity can have no equal. In this relation
we deal with one whom we respect more religiously
even than we respect our better selves, and we shall
necessarily conduct as in the presence of God. What
presence can be more awful to the lover than the presence
of his beloved?</p>

<p>If you seek the warmth even of affection from a
similar motive to that from which cats and dogs and
slothful persons hug the fire,&mdash;because your temperature
is low through sloth,&mdash;you are on the downward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
road, and it is but to plunge yet deeper into sloth.
Better the cold affection of the sun, reflected from fields
of ice and snow, or his warmth in some still, wintry
dell. The warmth of celestial love does not relax, but
nerves and braces its enjoyer. Warm your body by
healthful exercise, not by cowering over a stove. Warm
your spirit by performing independently noble deeds,
not by ignobly seeking the sympathy of your fellows
who are no better than yourself. A man's social and
spiritual discipline must answer to his corporeal. He
must lean on a friend who has a hard breast, as he
would lie on a hard bed. He must drink cold water
for his only beverage. So he must not hear sweetened
and colored words, but pure and refreshing truths. He
must daily bathe in truth cold as spring water, not
warmed by the sympathy of friends.</p>

<p>Can love be in aught allied to dissipation? Let us
love by refusing, not accepting one another. Love and
lust are far asunder. The one is good, the other bad.
When the affectionate sympathize by their higher natures,
there is love; but there is danger that they will
sympathize by their lower natures, and then there is
lust. It is not necessary that this be deliberate, hardly
even conscious; but, in the close contact of affection,
there is danger that we may stain and pollute one
another; for we cannot embrace but with an entire
embrace.</p>

<p>We must love our friend so much that she shall be
associated with our purest and holiest thoughts alone.
When there is impurity, we have "descended to meet,"
though we knew it not.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>luxury</i> of affection,&mdash;there's the danger. There
must be some nerve and heroism in our love, as of a
winter morning. In the religion of all nations a purity
is hinted at, which, I fear, men never attain to. We
may love and not elevate one another. The love that
takes us as it finds us degrades us. What watch we
must keep over the fairest and purest of our affections,
lest there be some taint about them! May we so love
as never to have occasion to repent of our love!</p>

<p>There is to be attributed to sensuality the loss to
language of how many pregnant symbols! Flowers,
which, by their infinite hues and fragrance, celebrate
the marriage of the plants, are intended for a symbol
of the open and unsuspected beauty of all true marriage,
when man's flowering season arrives.</p>

<p>Virginity, too, is a budding flower, and by an impure
marriage the virgin is deflowered. Whoever loves
flowers, loves virgins and chastity. Love and lust are
as far asunder as a flower-garden is from a brothel.</p>

<p>J. Biberg, in the "Amoenitates Botanicae," edited by
Linnæus, observes (I translate from the Latin): "The
organs of generation, which, in the animal kingdom,
are for the most part concealed by nature, as if they
were to be ashamed of, in the vegetable kingdom are
exposed to the eyes of all; and, when the nuptials of
plants are celebrated, it is wonderful what delight they
afford to the beholder, refreshing the senses with the
most agreeable color and the sweetest odor; and, at
the same time, bees and other insects, not to mention
the hummingbird, extract honey from their nectaries,
and gather wax from their effete pollen." Linnæus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
himself calls the calyx the <i>thalamus</i>, or bridal chamber;
and the corolla the <i>aulaeum</i>, or tapestry of it, and proceeds
to explain thus every part of the flower.</p>

<p>Who knows but evil spirits might corrupt the flowers
themselves, rob them of their fragrance and their fair
hues, and turn their marriage into a secret shame and
defilement? Already they are of various qualities, and
there is one whose nuptials fill the lowlands in June
with the odor of carrion.</p>

<p>The intercourse of the sexes, I have dreamed, is incredibly
beautiful, too fair to be remembered. I have
had thoughts about it, but they are among the most
fleeting and irrecoverable in my experience. It is
strange that men will talk of miracles, revelation, inspiration,
and the like, as things past, while love remains.</p>

<p>A true marriage will differ in no wise from illumination.
In all perception of the truth there is a divine
ecstasy, an inexpressible delirium of joy, as when a
youth embraces his betrothed virgin. The ultimate
delights of a true marriage are one with this.</p>

<p>No wonder that, out of such a union, not as end, but
as accompaniment, comes the undying race of man.
The womb is a most fertile soil.</p>

<p>Some have asked if the stock of men could not be
improved,&mdash;if they could not be bred as cattle. Let
Love be purified, and all the rest will follow. A pure
love is thus, indeed, the panacea for all the ills of the
world.</p>

<p>The only excuse for reproduction is improvement.
Nature abhors repetition. Beasts merely propagate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
their kind; but the offspring of noble men and women
will be superior to themselves, as their aspirations are.
By their fruits ye shall know them.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, February 27, 1853.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Blake</span>,&mdash;I have not answered your letter before,
because I have been almost constantly in the fields
surveying of late. It is long since I have spent many
days so profitably in a pecuniary sense; so unprofitably,
it seems to me, in a more important sense. I have
earned just a dollar a day for seventy-six days past;
for, though I charge at a higher rate for the days which
are seen to be spent, yet so many more are spent than
appears. This is instead of lecturing, which has not
offered, to pay for that book which I printed.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
 I have
not only cheap hours, but cheap weeks and months;
that is, weeks which are bought at the rate I have named.
Not that they are quite lost to me, or make me very
melancholy, alas! for I too often take a cheap satisfaction
in so spending them,&mdash;weeks of pasturing and
browsing, like beeves and deer,&mdash;which give me animal
health, it may be, but create a tough skin over the soul
and intellectual part. Yet, if men should offer my body
a maintenance for the work of my head alone, I feel
that it would be a dangerous temptation.</p>

<p>As to whether what you speak of as the "world's
way" (which for the most part is my way), or that
which is shown me, is the better, the former is imposture,
the latter is truth. I have the coldest confidence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
in the last. There is only such hesitation as the appetites
feel in following the aspirations. The clod hesitates
because it is inert, wants <i>animation</i>. The one is the
way of death, the other of life everlasting. My hours
are not "cheap in such a way that <i>I</i> doubt whether the
world's way would not have been better," but cheap
in such a way that I doubt whether the world's way,
which I have adopted for the time, could be worse.
The whole enterprise of this nation, which is not an
upward, but a westward one, toward Oregon, California,
Japan, etc., is totally devoid of interest to me,
whether performed on foot, or by a Pacific railroad. It
is not illustrated by a thought; it is not warmed by a
sentiment; there is nothing in it which one should lay
down his life for, nor even his gloves,&mdash;hardly which
one should take up a newspaper for. It is perfectly
heathenish,&mdash;a filibustering <i>toward</i> heaven by the great
western route. No; they may go their way to their
manifest destiny, which I trust is not mine. May my
seventy-six dollars, whenever I get them, help to carry
me in the other direction! I see them on their winding
way, but no music is wafted from their host,&mdash;only
the rattling of change in their pockets. I would rather
be a captive knight, and let them all pass by, than be
free only to go whither they are bound. What end do
they propose to themselves beyond Japan? What aims
more lofty have they than the prairie dogs?</p>

<p>As it respects these things, I have not changed an
opinion one iota from the first. As the stars looked
to me when I was a shepherd in Assyria, they look to
me now, a New-Englander. The higher the mountain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
on which you stand, the less change in the prospect
from year to year, from age to age. Above a certain
height there is no change. I am a Switzer on the edge
of the glacier, with his advantages and disadvantages,
goitre, or what not. (You may suspect it to be some
kind of swelling at any rate.) I have had but one <i>spiritual</i>
birth (excuse the word), and now whether it rains
or snows, whether I laugh or cry, fall farther below or
approach nearer to my standard; whether Pierce or
Scott is elected,&mdash;not a new scintillation of light flashes
on me, but ever and anon, though with longer intervals,
the same surprising and everlastingly new light dawns
to me, with only such variations as in the coming of the
natural day, with which, indeed, it is often coincident.</p>

<p>As to how to preserve potatoes from rotting, your
opinion may change from year to year; but as to how
to preserve your soul from rotting, I have nothing to
learn, but something to practice.</p>

<p>Thus I declaim against them; but I in my folly am
the world I condemn.</p>

<p>I very rarely, indeed, if ever, "feel any itching to be
what is called useful to my fellow-men." Sometimes&mdash;it
may be when my thoughts for want of employment
fall into a beaten path or humdrum&mdash;I have dreamed
idly of stopping a man's horse that was running away;
but, perchance, I wished that he might run, in order
that I might stop him;&mdash;or of putting out a fire; but
then, of course, it must have got well a-going. Now, to
tell the truth, I do not dream much of acting upon horses
before they run, or of preventing fires which are not
yet kindled. What a foul subject is this of doing good!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
instead of minding one's life, which should be his business;
doing good as a dead carcass, which is only fit
for manure, instead of as a living man,&mdash;instead of
taking care to flourish, and smell and taste sweet, and
refresh all mankind to the extent of our capacity and
quality. People will sometimes try to persuade you that
you have done something from that motive, as if you
did not already know enough about it. If I ever <i>did</i> a
man any good, in their sense, of course it was something
exceptional and insignificant compared with the
good or evil which I am constantly doing by being what
I am. As if you were to preach to ice to shape itself
into burning-glasses, which are sometimes useful, and
so the peculiar properties of ice be lost. Ice that merely
performs the office of a burning-glass does not do its
duty.</p>

<p>The problem of life becomes, one cannot say by how
many degrees, more complicated as our material wealth
is increased,&mdash;whether that needle they tell of was a
gateway or not,&mdash;since the problem is not merely nor
mainly to get life for our bodies, but by this or a similar
discipline to get life for our souls; by cultivating
the lowland farm on right principles, that is, with this
view, to turn it into an upland farm. You have so
many more talents to account for. If I accomplish as
much more in spiritual work as I am richer in worldly
goods, then I am just as worthy, or worth just as much,
as I was before, and no more. I see that, in my own
case, money <i>might</i> be of great service to me, but probably
it would not be; for the difficulty now is, that I do
not improve my opportunities, and therefore I am not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
prepared to have my opportunities increased. Now, I
warn you, if it be as you say, you have got to put on
the pack of an upland farmer in good earnest the coming
spring, the lowland farm being cared for; ay, you
must be selecting your seeds forthwith, and doing what
winter work you can; and, while others are raising
potatoes and Baldwin apples for you, you must be
raising apples of the Hesperides for them. (Only hear
how he preaches!) No man can suspect that he is the
proprietor of an upland farm,&mdash;upland in the sense
that it will produce nobler crops, and better repay cultivation
in the long run,&mdash;but he will be perfectly sure
that he ought to cultivate it.</p>

<p>Though we are desirous to earn our bread, we need
not be anxious to <i>satisfy</i> men for it,&mdash;though we shall
take care to pay them,&mdash;but God, who alone gave it
to us. Men may in effect put us in the debtors' jail for
that matter, simply for paying our whole debt to God,
which includes our debt to them, and though we have
His receipt for it,&mdash;for His paper is dishonored. The
cashier will tell you that He has no stock in his bank.</p>

<p>How prompt we are to satisfy the hunger and thirst
of our bodies; how slow to satisfy the hunger and
thirst of our <i>souls</i>! Indeed, we would-be practical
folks cannot use this word without blushing because
of our infidelity, having starved this substance almost
to a shadow. We feel it to be as absurd as if a man
were to break forth into a eulogy on <i>his dog</i>, who
has n't any. An ordinary man will work every day for
a year at shoveling dirt to support his body, or a family
of bodies; but he is an extraordinary man who will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
work a whole day in a year for the support of his
soul. Even the priests, the men of God, so called, for
the most part confess that they work for the support of
the body. But he alone is the truly enterprising and
practical man who succeeds in <i>maintaining</i> his soul
here. Have not we our everlasting life to get? and is
not that the only excuse at last for eating, drinking,
sleeping, or even carrying an umbrella when it rains?
A man might as well devote himself to raising pork as
to fattening the bodies, or temporal part merely, of the
whole human family. If we made the true distinction we
should almost all of us be seen to be in the almshouse
for souls.</p>

<p>I am much indebted to you because you look so
steadily at the better side, or rather the true centre of
me (for our true centre may, and perhaps oftenest
does, lie entirely aside from us, and we are in fact eccentric),
and, as I have elsewhere said, "give me an
opportunity to live." You speak as if the image or
idea which I see were reflected from me to you; and I
see it again reflected from you to me, because we stand
at the right angle to one another; and so it goes zigzag
to what successive reflecting surfaces, before it is all
dissipated or absorbed by the more unreflecting, or
differently reflecting,&mdash;who knows? Or, perhaps, what
you see directly, you refer to me. What a little shelf is
required, by which we may impinge upon another, and
build there our eyry in the clouds, and all the heavens
we see above us we refer to the crags around and beneath
us. Some piece of mica, as it were, in the face
or eyes of one, as on the Delectable Mountains, slanted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
at the right angle, reflects the heavens to us. But, in
the slow geological upheavals and depressions, these
mutual angles are disturbed, these suns set, and new
ones rise to us. That ideal which I worshiped was a
greater stranger to the mica than to me. It was not
the hero I admired, but the reflection from his epaulet
or helmet. It is nothing (for us) permanently inherent
in another, but his attitude or relation to what we
prize, that we admire. The meanest man may glitter
with micacious particles to his fellow's eye. These are
the spangles that adorn a man. The highest union,&mdash;the
only <i>un</i>-ion (don't laugh), or central oneness, is the
coincidence of visual rays. Our club-room was an
apartment in a constellation where our visual rays met
(and there was no debate about the restaurant). The
way between us is over the mount.</p>

<p>Your words make me think of a man of my acquaintance
whom I occasionally meet, whom you, too,
appear to have met, one Myself, as he is called. Yet,
why not call him <i>Your</i>self? If you have met with him
and know him, it is all I have done; and surely, where
there is a mutual acquaintance, the <i>my</i> and <i>thy</i> make
a distinction without a difference.</p>

<p>I do not wonder that you do not like my Canada
story. It concerns me but little, and probably is not
worth the time it took to tell it. Yet I had absolutely
no design whatever in my mind, but simply to report
what I saw. I have inserted all of myself that was implicated,
or made the excursion. It has come to an end,
at any rate; they will print no more, but return me my
MS. when it is but little more than half done, as well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
as another I had sent them, because the editor<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
 requires
the liberty to omit the heresies without consulting me,&mdash;a
privilege California is not rich enough to bid for.</p>

<p>I thank you again and again for attending to me;
that is to say, I am glad that you hear me and that
you also are glad. Hold fast to your most indefinite,
waking dream. The very green dust on the walls is an
organized vegetable; the atmosphere has its fauna and
flora floating in it; and shall we think that dreams are
but dust and ashes, are always disintegrated and crumbling
thoughts, and not dust-like thoughts trooping to
their standard with music,&mdash;systems beginning to be
organized? These expectations,&mdash;these are roots, these
are nuts, which even the poorest man has in his bin,
and roasts or cracks them occasionally in winter evenings,&mdash;which
even the poor debtor retains with his bed
and his pig, i. e., his idleness and sensuality. Men go
to the opera because they hear there a faint expression
in sound of this news which is never quite distinctly
proclaimed. Suppose a man were to sell the hue, the
least amount of coloring matter in the superficies of his
thought, for a farm,&mdash;were to exchange an absolute
and infinite value for a relative and finite one,&mdash;to
gain the whole world and lose his own soul!</p>

<p>Do not wait as long as I have before you write. If
you will look at another star, I will try to supply my
side of the triangle.</p>

<p>Tell Mr. Brown that I remember him, and trust
that he remembers me.</p>

<p>P. S.&mdash;Excuse this rather flippant preaching, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
does not cost me enough; and do not think that I
mean you <i>always</i>, though your letter <i>requested</i> the subjects.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, April 10, 1853.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Blake</span>,&mdash;Another singular kind of spiritual
football,&mdash;really nameless, handleless, homeless, like
myself,&mdash;a mere arena for thoughts and feelings; definite
enough outwardly, indefinite more than enough
inwardly. But I do not know why we should be styled
"misters" or "masters:" we come so near to being
anything or nothing, and seeing that we are mastered,
and not wholly sorry to be mastered, by the least phenomenon.
It seems to me that we are the mere creatures
of thought,&mdash;one of the lowest forms of intellectual
life, we men,&mdash;as the sunfish is of animal life.
As yet our thoughts have acquired no definiteness nor
solidity; they are purely molluscous, not vertebrate;
and the height of our existence is to float upward in
an ocean where the sun shines,&mdash;appearing only like
a vast soup or chowder to the eyes of the immortal
navigators. It is wonderful that I can be here, and
you there, and that we can correspond, and do many
other things, when, in fact, there is so little of us, either
or both, anywhere. In a few minutes, I expect, this
slight film or dash of vapor that I am will be what is
called asleep,&mdash;resting! forsooth from what? Hard
work? and thought? The hard work of the dandelion
down, which floats over the meadow all day; the hard
work of a pismire that labors to raise a hillock all day,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
and even by moonlight. Suddenly I can come forward
into the utmost apparent distinctness, and speak with
a sort of emphasis to you; and the next moment I am
so faint an entity, and make so slight an impression,
that nobody can find the traces of me. I try to hunt
myself up, and find the little of me that is discoverable
is falling asleep, and then I assist and tuck it up. It is
getting late. How can <i>I</i> starve or feed? Can <i>I</i> be said
to sleep? There is not enough of me even for that. If
you hear a noise,&mdash;'t ain't I,&mdash;'t ain't I,&mdash;as the dog
says with a tin kettle tied to his tail. I read of something
happening to another the other day: how happens it
that nothing ever happens to me? A dandelion down
that never alights,&mdash;settles,&mdash;blown off by a boy to
see if his mother wanted him,&mdash;some divine boy in
the upper pastures.</p>

<p>Well, if there really is another such a meteor sojourning
in these spaces, I would like to ask you if you know
whose estate this is that we are on? For my part I
enjoy it well enough, what with the wild apples and the
scenery; but I should n't wonder if the owner set his
dog on me next. I could remember something not
much to the purpose, probably; but if I stick to what
I do know, then&mdash;</p>

<p>It is worth the while to live respectably unto ourselves.
We can possibly <i>get along</i> with a neighbor, even
with a bedfellow, whom we respect but very little; but
as soon as it comes to this, that we do not respect ourselves,
then we do not get along at all, no matter how
much money we are paid for halting. There are old
heads in the world who cannot help me by their example
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
or advice to live worthily and satisfactorily to
myself; but I believe that it is in my power to elevate
myself this very hour above the common level of my
life. It is better to have your head in the clouds, and
know where you are, if indeed you cannot get it above
them, than to breathe the clearer atmosphere below
them, and think that you are in paradise.</p>

<p>Once you were in Milton<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
 doubting what to do. To
live a better life,&mdash;this surely can be done. Dot and
carry one. Wait not for a clear sight, for that you are
to get. What you see clearly you may omit to do.
Milton and Worcester? It is all Blake, Blake. Never
mind the rats in the wall; the cat will take care of
them. All that men have said or are is a very faint
rumor, and it is not worth the while to remember or
refer to that. If you are to meet God, will you refer to
anybody out of that court? How shall men know how
I succeed, unless they are in at the life? I did not see
the <i>Times</i> reporter there.</p>

<p>Is it not delightful to provide one's self with the
necessaries of life,&mdash;to collect dry wood for the fire
when the weather grows cool, or fruits when we grow
hungry?&mdash;not till then. And then we have all the
time left for thought!</p>

<p>Of what use were it, pray, to get a little wood to
burn, to warm your body this cold weather, if there
were not a divine fire kindled at the same time to warm
your spirit?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="i2">"Unless above himself he can</p>
<p>Erect himself, how poor a thing is man!"</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
I cuddle up by my stove, and there I get up another
fire which warms fire itself. Life is so short that it is
not wise to take roundabout ways, nor can we spend
much time in waiting. Is it absolutely necessary, then,
that we should do as we are doing? Are we chiefly
under obligations to the devil, like Tom Walker?
Though it is late to leave off this wrong way, it will
seem early the moment we begin in the right way; instead
of mid-afternoon, it will be early morning with
us. We have not got half-way to dawn yet.</p>

<p>As for the lectures, I feel that I have something to
say, especially on Traveling, Vagueness, and Poverty;
but I cannot come now. I will wait till I am fuller, and
have fewer engagements. Your suggestions will help
me much to write them when I am ready. I am going
to Haverhill<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
 to-morrow, surveying, for a week or more.
You met me on my last errand thither.</p>

<p>I trust that you realize what an exaggerator I am,&mdash;that
I lay myself out to exaggerate whenever I have an
opportunity,&mdash;pile Pelion upon Ossa, to reach heaven
so. Expect no trivial truth from me, unless I am on
the witness-stand. I will come as near to lying as you
can drive a coach and four. If it is n't thus and so with
me, it is with something. I am not particular whether
I get the shells or meat, in view of the latter's worth.</p>

<p>I see that I have not at all answered your letter, but
there is time enough for that.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, December 19, 1853.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Blake</span>,&mdash;My debt has accumulated so that I
should have answered your last letter at once, if I had
not been the subject of what is called a press of engagements,
having a lecture to write for last Wednesday,
and surveying more than usual besides. It has
been a kind of running fight with me,&mdash;the enemy not
always behind me I trust.</p>

<p>True, a man cannot lift himself by his own waistbands,
because he cannot get out of himself; but he
can expand himself (which is better, there being no up
nor down in nature), and so split his waistbands, being
already within himself.</p>

<p>You speak of doing and being, and the vanity, real
or apparent, of much doing. The suckers&mdash;I think it
is they&mdash;make nests in our river in the spring of more
than a cart-load of small stones, amid which to deposit
their ova. The other day I opened a muskrat's house.
It was made of weeds, five feet broad at base, and
three feet high, and far and low within it was a little
cavity, only a foot in diameter, where the rat dwelt.
It may seem trivial, this piling up of weeds, but so the
race of muskrats is preserved. We must heap up a
great pile of doing, for a small diameter of being. Is
it not imperative on us that we <i>do</i> something, if we
only work in a treadmill? And, indeed, some sort of
revolving is necessary to produce a centre and nucleus
of being. What exercise is to the body, employment is
to the mind and morals. Consider what an amount of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
drudgery must be performed,&mdash;how much humdrum
and prosaic labor goes to any work of the least value.
There are so many layers of mere white lime in every
shell to that thin inner one so beautifully tinted. Let
not the shellfish think to build his house of that alone;
and pray, what are its tints to him? Is it not his
smooth, close-fitting shirt merely, whose tints <i>are not</i> to
him, being in the dark, but only when he is gone or
dead, and his shell is heaved up to light, a wreck upon
the beach, do they appear. With him, too, it is a Song
of the Shirt, "Work,&mdash;work,&mdash;work!" And the
work is not merely a police in the gross sense, but in
the higher sense a discipline. If it is surely the means
to the highest end we know, can any work be humble
or disgusting? Will it not rather be elevating as a
ladder, the means by which we are translated?</p>

<p>How admirably the artist is made to accomplish his
self-culture by devotion to his art! The wood-sawyer,
through his effort to do his work well, becomes not
merely a better wood-sawyer, but measurably a better
<i>man</i>. Few are the men that can work on their navels,&mdash;only
some Brahmins that I have heard of. To the
painter is given some paint and canvas instead; to
the Irishman a hog, typical of himself. In a thousand
apparently humble ways men busy themselves to make
some right take the place of some wrong,&mdash;if it is only
to make a better paste blacking,&mdash;and they are themselves
<i>so much</i> the better morally for it.</p>

<p>You say that you do not succeed much. Does it
concern you enough that you do not? Do you work
hard enough at it? Do you get the benefit of discipline
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
out of it? If so, persevere. Is it a more serious thing
than to walk a thousand miles in a thousand successive
hours? Do you get any corns by it? Do you ever think
of hanging yourself on account of failure?</p>

<p>If you are going into that line,&mdash;going to besiege
the city of God,&mdash;you must not only be strong in engines,
but prepared with provisions to starve out the
garrison. An Irishman came to see me to-day, who is
endeavoring to get his family out to this New World.
He rises at half past four, milks twenty-eight cows
(which has swollen the joints of his fingers), and eats
his breakfast, without any milk in his tea or coffee,
before six; and so on, day after day, for six and a half
dollars a month; and thus he keeps his virtue in him,
if he does not add to it; and he regards me as a gentleman
able to assist him; but if I ever get to be a
gentleman, it will be by working after my fashion
harder than he does. If my joints are not swollen, it
must be because I deal with the teats of celestial cows
before breakfast (and the milker in this case is always
allowed some of the milk for his breakfast), to say
nothing of the flocks and herds of Admetus afterward.</p>

<p>It is the art of mankind to polish the world, and
every one who works is scrubbing in some part.</p>

<p>If the work is high and far,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>You must not only aim aright,</p>
<p>But draw the bow with all your might.</p>
</div></div>
<p>You must qualify yourself to use a bow which no humbler
archer can bend.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>
"Work,&mdash;work,&mdash;work!"</p></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span></p>

<p>Who shall know it for a bow? It is not of yew tree.
It is straighter than a ray of light; flexibility is not
known for one of its qualities.</p>

<p class="address">
December 22.</p>

<p>So far I had got when I was called off to survey.
Pray read the life of Haydon the painter, if you have
not. It is a small revelation for these latter days; a
great satisfaction to know that he has lived, though he
is now dead. Have you met with the letter of a Turkish
cadi at the end of Layard's "Ancient Babylon"?
that also is refreshing, and a capital comment on the
whole book which precedes it,&mdash;the Oriental genius
speaking through him.</p>

<p>Those Brahmins "put it through." They come off,
or rather stand still, conquerors, with some withered
arms or legs at least to show; and they are said to have
cultivated the faculty of abstraction to a degree unknown
to Europeans. If we cannot sing of faith and
triumph, we will sing our despair. We will be that
kind of bird. There are day owls, and there are night
owls, and each is beautiful and even musical while
about its business.</p>

<p>Might you not find some positive work to do with
your back to Church and State, letting your back do
all the rejection of them? Can you not <i>go</i> upon your
pilgrimage, Peter, along the winding mountain path
whither you face? A step more will make those funereal
church bells over your shoulder sound far and sweet as
a natural sound.</p>

<p>Why not make a <i>very large</i> mud pie and bake it in the

any other pepper-box that way. Dig out a woodchuck,&mdash;for
that has nothing to do with rotting institutions.

<p>Your last two letters, methinks, have more nerve and
will in them than usual, as if you had erected yourself
more. Why are not they good work, if you only had a
hundred correspondents to tax you?</p>

<p>Make your failure tragical by the earnestness and
steadfastness of your endeavor, and then it will not
differ from success. Prove it to be the inevitable fate
of mortals,&mdash;of one mortal,&mdash;if you can.</p>

<p>You said that you were writing on Immortality. I
wish you would communicate to me what you know
about that. You are sure to live while that is your
theme.</p>

<p>Thus I write on some text which a sentence of your
letters may have furnished.</p>

<p>I think of coming to see you as soon as I get a new
coat, if I have money enough left. I will write to you
again about it.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER).</p>

<p class="address"><span class="smcap">Concord</span>, January 21, 1854.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Blake</span>,&mdash;My coat is at last done, and my
mother and sister allow that I am <i>so far</i> in a condition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
to go abroad. I feel as if I had gone abroad the
moment I put it on. It is, as usual, a production
strange to me, the wearer,&mdash;invented by some Count
D'Orsay; and the maker of it was not acquainted with
any of my real depressions or elevations. He only
measured a peg to hang it on, and might have made the
loop big enough to go over my head. It requires a not
quite innocent indifference, not to say insolence, to
wear it. Ah! the process by which we get our coats is
not what it should be. Though the Church declares
it righteous, and its priest pardons me, my own good
genius tells me that it is hasty, and coarse, and false.
I expect a time when, or rather an integrity by which,
a man will get his coat as honestly and as perfectly
fitting as a tree its bark. Now our garments are typical
of our conformity to the ways of the world, <i>i. e.</i>, of
the devil, and to some extent react on us and poison
us, like that shirt which Hercules put on.</p>

<p>I think to come and see you next week, on Monday,
if nothing hinders. I have just returned from court at
Cambridge, whither I was called as a witness, having
surveyed a water-privilege, about which there is a dispute,
since you were here.</p>

<p>Ah! what foreign countries there are, greater in extent
than the United States or Russia, and with no more souls
to a square mile, stretching away on every side from
every human being with whom you have no sympathy.
Their humanity affects me as simply monstrous. Rocks,
earth, brute beasts, comparatively are not so strange to
me. When I sit in the parlors and kitchens of some
with whom my business brings me&mdash;I was going
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
to say in contact&mdash;(business, like misery, makes
strange bedfellows), I feel a sort of awe, and as forlorn
as if I were cast away on a desolate shore. I think of
Riley's Narrative<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
 and his sufferings. You, who soared
like a merlin with your mate through the realms of
æther, in the presence of the unlike, drop at once to
earth, a mere amorphous squab, divested of your air-inflated
pinions. (By the way, excuse this writing, for
I am using the stub of the last feather I chance to possess.)
You travel on, however, through this dark and
desert world; you see in the distance an intelligent and
sympathizing lineament; stars come forth in the dark,
and oases appear in the desert.</p>

<p>But (to return to the subject of coats), we are well-nigh
smothered under yet more fatal coats, which do
not fit us, our whole lives long. Consider the cloak
that our employment or station is; how rarely men
treat each other for what in their true and naked characters
they are; how we use and tolerate pretension;
how the judge is clothed with dignity which does not
belong to him, and the trembling witness with humility
that does not belong to him, and the criminal, perchance,
with shame or impudence which no more belong
to him. It does not matter so much, then, what is the
fashion of the cloak with which we cloak these cloaks.
Change the coat; put the judge in the criminal-box,
and the criminal on the bench, and you might think
that you had changed the men.</p>

<p>No doubt the thinnest of all cloaks is conscious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
deception or lies; it is sleazy and frays out; it is not
close-woven like cloth; but its meshes are a coarse network.
A man can afford to lie only at the intersection
of the threads; but truth puts in the filling, and makes
a consistent stuff.</p>

<p>I mean merely to suggest how much the station
affects the demeanor and self-respectability of the parties,
and that the difference between the judge's coat
of cloth and the criminal's is insignificant compared
with, or only partially significant of, the difference
between the coats which their respective stations permit
them to wear. What airs the judge may put on over
his coat which the criminal may not! The judge's
opinion (<i>sententia</i>) of the criminal <i>sentences</i> him, and
is read by the clerk of the court, and published to the
world, and executed by the sheriff; but the criminal's
opinion of the judge has the weight of a sentence, and
is published and executed only in the supreme court
of the universe,&mdash;a court not of common pleas. How
much juster is the one than the other? Men are continually
<i>sentencing</i> each other; but, whether we be
judges or criminals, the sentence is ineffectual unless
we continue ourselves.</p>

<p>I am glad to hear that I do not always limit your
vision when you look this way; that you sometimes see
the light through me; that I am here and there windows,
and not all dead wall. Might not the community
sometimes petition a man to remove himself as a
nuisance, a darkener of the day, a too large mote?

<p class="center p2">TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, August 8, 1854.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Blake</span>,&mdash;Methinks I have spent a rather unprofitable
summer thus far. I have been too much
with the world, as the poet might say.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
 The completest
performance of the highest duties it imposes would
yield me but little satisfaction. Better the neglect of all
such, because your life passed on a level where it was
impossible to recognize them. Latterly, I have heard
the very flies buzz too distinctly, and have accused myself
because I did not still this superficial din. We
must not be too easily distracted by the crying of children
or of dynasties. The Irishman erects his sty, and
gets drunk, and jabbers more and more under my
eaves, and I am responsible for all that filth and folly.
I find it, as ever, very unprofitable to have much to do
with men. It is sowing the wind, but not reaping even
the whirlwind; only reaping an unprofitable calm and
stagnation. Our conversation is a smooth, and civil,
and never-ending speculation merely. I take up the
thread of it again in the morning, with very much such
courage as the invalid takes his prescribed Seidlitz
powders. Shall I help you to some of the mackerel?
It would be more respectable if men, as has been said
before, instead of being such pigmy desperates, were
Giant Despairs. Emerson says that his life is so unprofitable
and shabby for the most part, that he is driven
to all sorts of resources, and, among the rest, to men.
I tell him that we differ only in our resources. Mine is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
to get away from men. They very rarely affect me as
grand or beautiful; but I know that there is a sunrise
and a sunset every day. In the summer, this world is
a mere watering-place,&mdash;a Saratoga,&mdash;drinking so
many tumblers of Congress water; and in the winter,
is it any better, with its oratorios? I have seen more
men than usual, lately; and, well as I was acquainted
with one, I am surprised to find what vulgar fellows
they are. They do a little business commonly each day,
in order to pay their board, and then they congregate
in sitting-rooms and feebly fabulate and paddle in the
social slush; and when I think that they have sufficiently
relaxed, and am prepared to see them steal
away to their shrines, they go unashamed to their beds,
and take on a new layer of sloth. They may be single,
or have families in their <i>faineancy</i>. I do not meet men
who can have nothing to do with me because they have
so much to do with themselves. However, I trust that
a very few cherish purposes which they never declare.
Only think, for a moment, of a man about his affairs!
How we should respect him! How glorious he would
appear! Not working for any corporation, its agent, or
president, but fulfilling the end of his being! A man
about <i>his business</i> would be the cynosure of all eyes.</p>

<p>The other evening I was determined that I would
silence this shallow din; that I would walk in various
directions and see if there was not to be found any
depth of silence around. As Bonaparte sent out his
horsemen in the Red Sea on all sides to find shallow
water, so I sent forth my mounted thoughts to find
deep water. I left the village and paddled up the river
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
to Fair Haven Pond. As the sun went down, I saw a
solitary boatman disporting on the smooth lake. The
falling dews seemed to strain and purify the air, and I
was smoothed with an infinite stillness. I got the world,
as it were, by the nape of the neck, and held it under
in the tide of its own events, till it was drowned, and
then I let it go down-stream like a dead dog. Vast
hollow chambers of silence stretched away on every
side, and my being expanded in proportion, and filled
them. Then first could I appreciate sound, and find it
musical.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
</p>

<p>But now for your news. Tell us of the year. Have
you fought the good fight? What is the state of your
crops? Will your harvest answer well to the seed-time,
and are you cheered by the prospect of stretching cornfields?
Is there any blight on your fields, any murrain
in your herds? Have you tried the size and quality of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
your potatoes? It does one good to see their balls dangling
in the lowlands. Have you got your meadow hay
before the fall rains shall have set in? Is there enough
in your barns to keep your cattle over? Are you killing
weeds nowadays? or have you earned leisure to go
a-fishing? Did you plant any Giant Regrets last spring,
such as I saw advertised? It is not a new species, but
the result of cultivation and a fertile soil. They are
excellent for sauce. How is it with your marrow
squashes for winter use? Is there likely to be a sufficiency
of fall feed in your neighborhood? What is the
state of the springs? I read that in your county there
is more water on the hills than in the valleys. Do you
find it easy to get all the help you require? Work early
and late, and let your men and teams rest at noon. Be
careful not to drink too much sweetened water, while
at your hoeing, this hot weather. You can bear the
heat much better for it.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO MARSTON WATSON (AT PLYMOUTH).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, September 19, 1854.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am glad to hear from you and the
Plymouth men again. The world still holds together
between Concord and Plymouth, it seems. I should
like to be with you while Mr. Alcott is there, but I
cannot come next Sunday. I will come Sunday after
next, that is, October 1st, if that will do; and look
out for you at the depot. I do not like to promise
more than one discourse. Is there a good precedent for
two?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">The first of Thoreau's many lecturing visits to
Worcester, the home of his friend Blake, was in April,
1849, and from that time onward he must have read
lectures there at least annually, until his last illness,
in 1861-62. By 1854, the lecturing habit, in several
places besides Concord, had become established; and
there was a constant interchange of visits and excursions
with his friends at Worcester, Plymouth, New
Bedford, etc. Soon after the publication of "Walden,"
in the summer of 1854, Thoreau wrote these notes to
Mr. Blake, touching on various matters of friendly
interest.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER).</p>

<p class="address"><span class="smcap">Concord</span>, September 21, 1854.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blake</span>,&mdash;I have just read your letter, but do not
mean now to answer it, solely for want of time to say
what I wish. I directed a copy of "Walden" to you
at Ticknor's, on the day of its publication, and it
should have reached you before. I am encouraged to
know that it interests you as it now stands,&mdash;a printed
book,&mdash;for you apply a very severe test to it,&mdash;you
make the highest demand on me. As for the excursion
you speak of, I should like it right well,&mdash;indeed I
thought of proposing the same thing to you and Brown,
some months ago. Perhaps it would have been better
if I had done so then; for in that case I should have
been able to enter into it with that infinite margin to
my views,&mdash;spotless of all engagements,&mdash;which I
think so necessary. As it is, I have agreed to go a-lecturing
to Plymouth, Sunday after next (October 1) and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
to Philadelphia in November, and thereafter to the
West, <i>if they shall want me</i>; and, as I have prepared
nothing in that shape, I feel as if my hours were spoken
for. However, I think that, after having been to Plymouth,
I may take a day or two&mdash;if that date will suit
you and Brown. <i>At any rate</i> I will write to you then.</p>

<p class="address p2"><span class="smcap">Concord</span>, October 5, 1854.</p>

<p>After I wrote to you, Mr. Watson postponed my
going to Plymouth one week, <i>i. e.</i>, till next Sunday;
and now he wishes me to carry my instruments and
survey his grounds, to which he has been adding. Since
I want a little money, though I contemplate but a short
excursion, I do not feel at liberty to decline this work.
I do not know exactly how long it will detain me,&mdash;but
there is plenty of time yet, and I will write to you
again&mdash;perhaps from Plymouth.</p>

<p>There is a Mr. Thomas Cholmondeley (pronounced
Chumly), a young English author, staying at our house
at present, who asks me to teach him <i>botany</i>&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>,
anything which I know; and also to make an excursion
to some mountain with him. He is a well-behaved person,
and <i>possibly</i> I may propose his taking that run
to Wachusett with us&mdash;if it will be agreeable to you.
Nay, if I do not hear any objection from you, I will
consider myself <i>at liberty</i> to invite him.</p>

<p class="address p2">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, Saturday <span class="smcap">P. M.</span>, October 14, 1854.
</p>

<p>I have just returned from Plymouth, where I have
been detained surveying much longer than I expected.
What do you say to visiting Wachusett next Thursday?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
I will start at 7¼ <span class="smcap">A. M.</span> <i>unless there is a prospect of a
stormy day</i>, go by cars to Westminster, and thence on
foot five or six miles to the mountain-top, where I may
engage to meet you, at (or before) 12 <span class="smcap">M.</span> If the weather
is unfavorable, I will try again, on Friday,&mdash;and again
on Monday. If a storm comes on after starting, I will
seek you at the tavern at Princeton centre, as soon as
circumstances will permit. I shall expect an answer at
once, to clinch the bargain.</p>

<p class="p2">The year 1854 was a memorable one in Thoreau's
life, for it brought out his most successful book, "Walden,"
and introduced him to the notice of the world,
which had paid small attention to his first book, the
"Week," published five years earlier. This year also
made him acquainted with two friends to whom he
wrote much, and who loved to visit and stroll with him
around Concord, or in more distant places,&mdash;Thomas
Cholmondeley, an Englishman from Shropshire, and
Daniel Ricketson, a New Bedford Quaker, of liberal
mind and cultivated tastes,&mdash;an author and poet, and
fond of corresponding with poets, as he did with the
Howitts and William Barnes of England, and with
Bryant, Emerson, Channing, and Thoreau, in America.
Few of the letters to Cholmondeley are yet found, being
buried temporarily in the mass of family papers at
Condover Hall, an old Elizabethan mansion near
Shrewsbury, which Thomas Cholmondeley inherited,
and which remains in his family's possession since his
own death at Florence in 1864. But the letters of the
Englishman, recently printed in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
(December, 1893), show how sincere was the attachment
of this ideal friend to the Concord recluse, and
how well he read that character which the rest of England,
and a good part of America, have been so slow
to recognize for what it really was.</p>

<p>Thomas Cholmondeley was the eldest son of Rev.
Charles Cowper Cholmondeley, rector of Overleigh,
Cheshire, and of a sister to Reginald Heber, the celebrated
bishop of Calcutta. He was born in 1823, and
brought up at Hodnet, in Shropshire, where his father,
a cousin of Lord Delamere, had succeeded his brother-in-law
as rector, on the departure of Bishop Heber for
India, in 1823. The son was educated at Oriel College,
Oxford,&mdash;a friend, and perhaps pupil of Arthur
Hugh Clough, who gave him letters to Emerson in
1854. Years before, after leaving Oxford, he had gone
with some relatives to New Zealand, and before coming
to New England he had published a book, "Ultima
Thule," describing that Australasian colony of
England, where he lived for part of a year. He had
previously studied in Germany, and traveled on the
Continent. He landed in America the first time in
August, 1854, and soon after went to Concord, where,
at the suggestion of Emerson, he became an inmate
of Mrs. Thoreau's family. This made him intimate
with Henry Thoreau for a month or two, and also
brought him into acquaintance with Ellery Channing,
then living across the main street of Concord, in the
west end of the village, and furnishing to Thoreau a
landing-place for his boat under the willows at the foot
of Channing's small garden. Alcott was not then in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
Concord, but Cholmondeley made his acquaintance in
Boston, and admired his character and manners.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i-279" id="i-279"></a>
<img src="images/i-279.jpg" width="550" height="385" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>Thoreau's Boat-landing, Concord River</i></p>
</div>

<p>With Channing and Thoreau the young Englishman
visited their nearest mountain, Wachusett, and in some
of their walks the artist Rowse, who had made the
first portrait of Thoreau, joined, for he was then in
Concord, late in 1854, engraving the fine head of Daniel
Webster from a painting by Ames, and this engraving
he gave both to Thoreau and to Cholmondeley. In
December the Englishman, whose patriotism was
roused by the delays and calamities of England in her
Crimean war, resolved to go home and raise a company,
as he did, first spending some weeks in lodgings at
Boston (Orange Street) in order to hear Theodore
Parker preach and visit Harvard College, of which I
was then a student, in the senior class. He visited me
and my classmate, Edwin Morton, and called on some
of the Cambridge friends of Clough. In January, 1855,
he sailed for England, and there received the letter of
Thoreau printed on pages <a href="#Page_249">249</a>-<a href="#Page_251">251</a>.</p>

<p>The acquaintance with Mr. Ricketson began by letter
before Cholmondeley reached Concord, but Thoreau
did not visit him until December, 1854. Mr. Ricketson
says, "In the summer of 1854 I purchased, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
New Bedford, a copy of 'Walden.' I had never heard
of its author, but in this admirable and most original
book I found so many observations on plants, birds,
and natural objects generally in which I was also interested,
that I felt at once I had found a congenial
spirit. During this season I was rebuilding a house in
the country, three miles from New Bedford, and had
erected a small building which was called my 'shanty;'
and my family being then in my city house, I made
this building my temporary home. From it I addressed
my first letter to the author of 'Walden.' In reply he
wrote, 'I had duly received your very kind and frank
letter, but delayed to answer it thus long because I
have little skill as a correspondent, and wished to send
you something more than my thanks. I was gratified
by your prompt and hearty acceptance of my book.
Yours is the only word of greeting I am likely to receive
from a dweller in the woods like myself,&mdash;from
where the whip-poor-will and cuckoo are heard, and
there are better than moral clouds drifting over, and
real breezes blow.' From that year until his death in
1862 we exchanged visits annually, and letters more
frequently. He was much interested in the botany of
our region, finding here many marine plants he had
not before seen. When our friendship began, the admirers
of his only two published books were few;
most prominent among them were Emerson, Alcott,
and Channing of Concord, Messrs. Blake and T.
Brown of Worcester, Mr. Marston Watson of Plymouth,
and myself. Many accused him of being an imitator
of Emerson; others thought him unsocial, impracticable,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
and ascetic. Now he was none of these; a more original
man never lived, nor one more thoroughly personifying
civility; no man could hold a finer relationship
with his family than he."</p>

<p>In reply to Mr. Ricketson's first letter (August 12,
1854) above mentioned, Thoreau sent, after six weeks'
delay, the reply of October 1, the beginning of which
was just quoted. Continuing, Thoreau said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your account excites in me a desire to see the
Middleborough ponds, of which I had already heard
somewhat; as also some very beautiful ponds on the
Cape, in Harwich, I think, near which I once passed.
I have sometimes also thought of visiting that remnant
of <i>our</i> Indians still living near you. But then, you
know, there is nothing like one's native fields and lakes.
The best news you send me is, not that Nature with
you is so fair and genial, but that there is one there
who likes her so well. That proves all that was
asserted.</p>

<p>"Homer, of course, you include in your list of lovers
of Nature; and, by the way, let me mention here&mdash;for
this is 'my thunder' lately&mdash;William Gilpin's long
series of books on the Picturesque, with their illustrations.
If it chances that you have not met with these,
I cannot just now frame a better wish than that you
may one day derive as much pleasure from the inspection
of them as I have.</p>

<p>"Much as you have told me of yourself, you have
still, I think, a little the advantage of me in this correspondence,
for I have told you still more in my book.
You have therefore the broadest mark to fire at.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span></p>

<p>"A young English author, Thomas Cholmondeley,
is just now waiting for me to take a walk with him;
therefore excuse this very barren note from</p>

<p class="left45">
"Yours, hastily at last."</p>

<p>Between the letter just quoted and Thoreau's next,
of December 19, 1854, a letter is obviously missing.
Mr. Ricketson had answered (October 12), the first
letter, and on December 14 had written again to convey
an invitation from Mr. Mitchell that Thoreau
should lecture at New Bedford, the 26th, on his way
to Nantucket for the 28th. Probably Thoreau had
replied to the letter of October 12, and to the invitation
to bring Cholmondeley with him in the pleasant
October season. In this reply he had said something
which called forth from Ricketson an expression of
sympathy, as well as the December invitation; for
Thoreau thus replied to the letter of December 14:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center p2">TO DANIEL RICKETSON (AT NEW BEDFORD).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, December 19, 1854.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I wish to thank you for your sympathy.
I had counted on seeing you when I came to
New Bedford, though I did not know exactly how near
to it you permanently dwelt; therefore I gladly accept
your invitation to stop at your house. I am going to
lecture at Nantucket the 28th, and as I suppose I must
improve the earliest opportunity to get there from New
Bedford, I will endeavor to come on Monday, that I
may see yourself and New Bedford before my lecture.</p>

<p>I should like right well to see your ponds, but that is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
hardly to be thought of at present. I fear that it is
impossible for me to combine such things with the
business of lecturing. You cannot serve God and
Mammon. However, perhaps I shall have time to see
something of your country. I am aware that you
have not so much snow as we; there has been excellent
sleighing here since the 5th inst.</p>

<p>Mr. Cholmondeley has left us, so that I shall come
alone. Will you be so kind as to warn Mr. Mitchell
that I accept at once his invitation to lecture on the
26th of this month, for I do not know that he has got
my letter. Excuse this short note.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>

<p>I confess that I am a very bad correspondent, so far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
as promptness of reply is concerned; but then I am
sure to answer sooner or later. The longer I have forgotten
you, the more I remember you. For the most
part I have not been idle since I saw you. How does
the world go with you? or rather, how do you get
along without it? I have not yet learned to live, that
I can see, and I fear that I shall not very soon. I find,
however, that in the long run things correspond to my
original idea,&mdash;that they correspond to nothing else so
much; and thus a man may really be a true prophet
without any great exertion. The day is never so dark,
nor the night even, but that the laws at least of light
still prevail, and so may make it light in our minds if
they are open to the truth. There is considerable
danger that a man will be crazy between dinner and
supper; but it will not directly answer any good purpose
that I know of, and it is just as easy to be sane.
We have got to know what both life and death are, before
we can begin to live after our own fashion. Let us
be learning our a-b-c's as soon as possible. I never yet
knew the sun to be knocked down and rolled through
a mud-puddle; he comes out honor-bright from behind
every storm. Let us then take sides with the sun, seeing
we have so much leisure. Let us not put all we
prize into a football to be kicked, when a bladder will
do as well.</p>

<p>When an Indian is burned, his body may be broiled,
it may be no more than a beefsteak. What of that?
They may broil his <i>heart</i>, but they do not therefore
broil his <i>courage</i>,&mdash;his principles. Be of good courage!
That is the main thing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span></p>

<p>If a man were to place himself in an attitude to bear
manfully the greatest evil that can be inflicted on him,
he would find suddenly that there was no such evil to
bear; his brave back would go a-begging. When Atlas
got his back made up, that was all that was required.
(In this case <i>a priv.</i>, not <i>pleon.</i>, and <span class="greek" title="tlêmi">τλῆμι</span>.) The world
rests on principles. The wise gods will never make
underpinning of a man. But as long as he crouches,
and skulks, and shirks his work, every creature that has
weight will be treading on his toes, and crushing him;
he will himself tread with one foot on the other foot.</p>

<p>The monster is never just there where we think he
is. What is truly monstrous is our cowardice and sloth.</p>

<p>Have no idle disciplines like the Catholic Church
and others; have only positive and fruitful ones. Do
what you know you ought to do. Why should we ever
go abroad, even across the way, to ask a neighbor's
advice? There is a nearer neighbor within us incessantly
telling us how we should behave. But we wait
for the neighbor without to tell us of some false, easier
way.</p>

<p>They have a census-table in which they put down
the number of the insane. Do you believe that they
put them all down there? Why, in every one of these
houses there is at least one man fighting or squabbling
a good part of his time with a dozen pet demons of his
own breeding and cherishing, which are relentlessly
gnawing at his vitals; and if perchance he resolve at
length that he will courageously combat them, he says,
"Ay! ay! I will attend to you after dinner!" And,
when that time comes, he concludes that he is good for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
another stage, and reads a column or two about the
<i>Eastern War</i>! Pray, to be in earnest, where is Sevastopol?
Who is Menchikoff? and Nicholas behind there?
who the Allies? Did not we fight a little (little enough
to be sure, but just enough to make it interesting) at
Alma, at Balaclava, at Inkermann? We love to fight
far from home. Ah! the Minié musket is the king of
weapons. Well, let us get one then.</p>

<p>I just put another stick into my stove,&mdash;a pretty
large mass of white oak. How many men will do
enough this cold winter to pay for the fuel that will be
required to warm them? I suppose I have burned up
a pretty good-sized tree to-night,&mdash;and for what? I
settled with Mr. Tarbell for it the other day; but that
was n't the final settlement. I got off cheaply from him.
At last, one will say, "Let us see, how much wood did
you burn, sir?" And I shall shudder to think that the
next question will be, "What did you do while you
were warm?" Do we think the ashes will pay for it?
that God is an ash-man? It is a fact that we have got
to render an account for the deeds done in the body.</p>

<p>Who knows but we shall be better the next year than
we have been the past? At any rate, I wish you a
really <i>new</i> year,&mdash;commencing from the instant you
read this,&mdash;and happy or unhappy, according to your
deserts.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO HARRISON BLAKE.</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, December 22, 1854.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Blake</span>,&mdash;I will lecture for your Lyceum on
the 4th of January next; and I hope that I shall have
time for that good day out of doors. Mr. Cholmondeley
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
is in Boston, yet <i>perhaps</i> I may invite him to
accompany me. I have engaged to lecture at New
Bedford on the 26th inst., stopping with Daniel Ricketson,
three miles out of town; and at Nantucket on
the 28th, so that I shall be gone all next week. They
say there is some danger of being weather-bound at
Nantucket; but I see that others run the same risk.
You had better acknowledge the receipt of this at any
rate, though you should write nothing else; otherwise
I shall not know whether you get it; but perhaps you
will not wait till you have seen me, to answer my letter
(of December 19). I will tell you what I think of lecturing
when I see you. Did you see the notice of "Walden"
in the last <i>Anti-Slavery Standard</i>? You will not
be surprised if I tell you that it reminded me of you.</p>

<p class="p2">On the Christmas Day that Thoreau reached New
Bedford, he had left home in the forenoon, as usual in
his Cambridge visits, spent some time at Harvard College,
and gone on by the train in the afternoon, which
accounted for his delay. His host, who then saw him
for the first time, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I had expected him at noon, but as he did not
arrive, I had given him up for the day. In the latter
part of the afternoon I was clearing off the snow from
my front steps, when, looking up, I saw a man walking
up the carriage-road, bearing a portmanteau in one
hand and an umbrella in the other. He was dressed
in a long overcoat of dark color, and wore a dark soft
hat. I had no suspicion it was Thoreau, and rather
supposed it was a peddler of small wares."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span></p>

<p>This was a common mistake to make. When Thoreau
ran the gantlet of the Cape Cod villages,&mdash;"feeling
as strange," he says, "as if he were in a town in
China,"&mdash;one of the old fishermen could not believe
that he had not something to sell. Being finally satisfied
that it was not a peddler with his pack, the old
man said, "Wal, it makes no odds what 't is you carry,
so long as you carry Truth along with ye." Mr. Ricketson
came to the same conclusion about his visitor,
and in the early September of 1855 returned the visit.</p>

<p>On the 4th of January, 1855, Ricketson wrote, saying,
"Your visit, short as it was, gave us all at Brooklawn
much satisfaction;" adding that he might visit
Concord late in January, when he expected to be in
Boston. Thoreau replied:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center p2">TO DANIEL RICKETSON (AT NEW BEDFORD).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, January 6, 1855.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Ricketson</span>,&mdash;I am pleased to hear from the
shanty, whose inside and occupant I have seen. I had
a very pleasant time at Brooklawn, as you know, and
thereafter at Nantucket. I was obliged to pay the usual
tribute to the sea, but it was more than made up to
me by the hospitality of the Nantucketers. Tell Arthur
that I can now compare notes with him; for though I
went neither before nor behind the mast, since we
had n't any, I went with my head hanging over the
side all the way.</p>

<p>In spite of all my experience, I persisted in reading
to the Nantucket people the lecture which I read at
New Bedford, and I found them to be the very audience
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
for me. I got home Friday night, after being lost
in the fog off Hyannis.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
 I have not yet found a new
jackknife, but I had a glorious skating with Channing
the other day, on the skates found long ago.</p>

<p>Mr. Cholmondeley sailed for England direct, in the
America, on the 3d, after spending a night with me.
He thinks even to go to the East and enlist. Last night
I returned from lecturing in Worcester.</p>

<p>I shall be glad to see you when you come to Boston,
as will also my mother and sister, who know something
about you as an abolitionist. Come directly to our
house. Please remember me to Mrs. Ricketson, and
also to the young folks.</p>

<p class="p2">After writing that he expected to be at the anti-slavery
meetings in Boston, January 24 and 25, ill
health and a snow-storm detained Ricketson at Brooklawn,
whereupon Thoreau wrote:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">TO DANIEL RICKETSON (AT NEW BEDFORD).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, February 1, 1855.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I supposed, as I did not see you on the
24th or 25th, that some track or other was obstructed;
but the solid earth still holds together between New
Bedford and Concord, and I trust that as this time you
stayed away, you may live to come another day.</p>

<p>I did not go to Boston, for with regard to that place
I sympathize with one of my neighbors, an old man,
who has not been there since the last war, when he was
compelled to go. No, I have a real genius for staying
at home.</p>

<p>I have been looking of late at Bewick's tail-pieces in
the "Birds,"&mdash;all they have of him at Harvard. Why
will he be a little vulgar at times? Yesterday I made
an excursion up our river,&mdash;skated some thirty miles
in a few hours, if you will believe it. So with reading
and writing and skating the night comes round
again.</p>

<p class="p2">The early part of 1855 was spent by Thomas
Cholmondeley in a tiresome passage to England, whence
he wrote (January 27) to say to Thoreau that he had
reached Shropshire, and been commissioned captain in
the local militia, in preparation for service at Sevastopol,
but reminding his Concord friend of a half promise
to visit England some day. To this Thoreau
made answer thus:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">TO THOMAS CHOLMONDELEY (AT HODNET).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, Mass., February 7, 1855.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Cholmondeley</span>,&mdash;I am glad to hear that you
have arrived safely at Hodnet, and that there is a solid
piece of ground of that name which can support a man
better than a floating plank, in that to me as yet purely
historical England. But have I not seen you with my
own eyes, a piece of England herself, and was not your
letter come out to me thence? I have now reason to
believe that Salop is as real a place as Concord; with
at least as good an underpinning of granite, floating on
liquid fire. I congratulate you on having arrived safely
at that floating isle, after your disagreeable passage in
the steamer America. So are we not all making a passage,
agreeable or disagreeable, in the steamer Earth,
trusting to arrive at last at some less undulating Salop
and brother's house?</p>

<p>I cannot say that I am surprised to hear that you
have joined the militia, after what I have heard from
your lips; but I am glad to doubt if there will be occasion
for your volunteering into the line. Perhaps I am
thinking of the saying that it "is always darkest just
before day." I believe it is only necessary that England
be fully awakened to a sense of her position, in order
that she may right herself, especially as the weather
will soon cease to be her foe. I wish I could believe
that the cause in which you are embarked is the cause
of the people of England. However, I have no sympathy
with the idleness that would contrast this fighting
with the teachings of the pulpit; for, perchance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
more true virtue is being practiced at Sevastopol than
in many years of peace. It is a pity that we seem to
require a war, from time to time, to assure us that there
is any manhood still left in man.</p>

<p>I was much pleased with [J. J. G.] Wilkinson's vigorous
and telling assault on Allopathy, though he substitutes
another and perhaps no stronger <i>thy</i> for that.
Something as good on the whole conduct of the war
would be of service. Cannot Carlyle supply it? We
will not require him to provide the remedy. Every man
to his trade. As you know, I am not in any sense a
politician. You, who live in that snug and compact
isle, may dream of a glorious commonwealth, but I have
some doubts whether I and the new king of the Sandwich
Islands shall pull together. When I think of the
gold-diggers and the Mormons, the slaves and the slaveholders
and the flibustiers, I naturally dream of a glorious
private life. No, I am not patriotic; I shall not
meddle with the Gem of the Antilles. General Quitman<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>

cannot count on my aid, alas for him! nor can
General Pierce.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
</p>

<p>I still take my daily walk, or skate over Concord
fields or meadows, and on the whole have more to do
with nature than with man. We have not had much
snow this winter, but have had some remarkably cold
weather, the mercury, February 6, not rising above 6°
below zero during the day, and the next morning falling
to 26°. Some ice is still thirty inches thick about us.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
A rise in the river has made uncommonly good skating,
which I have improved to the extent of some thirty
miles a day, fifteen out and fifteen in.</p>

<p>Emerson is off westward, enlightening the Hamiltonians
[in Canada] and others, mingling his thunder with
that of Niagara. Channing still sits warming his five
wits&mdash;his sixth, you know, is always limber&mdash;over
that stove, with the dog down cellar. Lowell has just
been appointed Professor of Belles-Lettres in Harvard
University, in place of Longfellow, resigned, and will
go very soon to spend another year in Europe, before
taking his seat.</p>

<p>I am from time to time congratulating myself on my
general want of success as a lecturer; apparent want of
success, but is it not a real triumph? I do my work
clean as I go along, and they will not be likely to want
me anywhere again. So there is no danger of my
repeating myself, and getting to a barrel of sermons,
which you must upset, and begin again with.</p>

<p>My father and mother and sister all desire to be
remembered to you, and trust that you will never come
within range of Russian bullets. Of course, I would
rather think of you as settled down there in Shropshire,
in the camp of the English people, making acquaintance
with your men, striking at the root of the evil,
perhaps assaulting that rampart of cotton bags that
you tell of. But it makes no odds where a man goes or
stays, if he is only about his business.</p>

<p>Let me hear from you, wherever you are, and believe
me yours ever in the good fight, whether before Sevastopol
or under the wreken.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">While Cholmondeley's first letter from England was
on its way to Concord, Thoreau was one day making
his occasional call at the Harvard College Library
(where he found and was allowed to take away volumes
relating to his manifold studies), when it occurred
to him to call at my student-chamber in Holworthy
Hall, and there leave a copy of his "Week." I had
never met him, and was then out; the occasion of his
call was a review of his two books that had come out a
few weeks earlier in the <i>Harvard Magazine</i>, of which
I was an editor and might be supposed to have had
some share in the criticism. The volume was left with
my classmate Lyman, accompanied by a message that
it was intended for the critic in the Magazine. Accordingly,
I gave it to Edwin Morton, who was the
reviewer, and notified Thoreau by letter of that fact,
and of my hope to see him soon in Cambridge or Concord.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>

To this he replied in a few days as below:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center p2">TO F. B. SANBORN (AT HAMPTON FALLS, N. H.).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, February 2, 1855.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I fear that you did not get the note
which I left with the Librarian for you, and so will
thank you again for your politeness. I was sorry that
I was obliged to go into Boston almost immediately.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
However, I shall be glad to see you whenever you come
to Concord, and I will suggest nothing to discourage
your coming, so far as I am concerned; trusting that
you know what it is to take a partridge on the wing.
You tell me that the author of the criticism is Mr.
Morton. I had heard as much,&mdash;and indeed guessed
more. I have latterly found Concord nearer to Cambridge
than I believed I should, when I was leaving
my Alma Mater; and hence you will not be surprised
if even I feel some interest in the success of the <i>Harvard
Magazine</i>.</p>

<p class="left45">
Believe me yours truly,<br />
<span class="smcap  i4">Henry D. Thoreau</span>.</p>

<p>At this time I was under engagement with Mr.
Emerson and others in Concord to take charge of a
small school there in March; and did so without again
seeing the author of "Walden" in Cambridge. Soon
after my settlement at Concord, in the house of Mr.
Channing, just opposite Thoreau's, he made an evening
call on me and my sister (April 11, 1855), but I
had already met him more than once at Mr. Emerson's,
and was even beginning to take walks with him, as
frequently happened in the next six years. In the following
summer I began to dine daily at his mother's
table, and thus saw him almost every day for three
years.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, June 27, 1855.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Blake</span>,&mdash;I have been sick and good for nothing
but to lie on my back and wait for something to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
turn up, for two or three months. This has <i>compelled
me</i> to postpone several things, among them writing to
you, to whom I am so deeply in debt, and inviting you
and Brown to Concord,&mdash;not having brains adequate
to such an exertion. I should feel a little less ashamed
if I could give any name to my disorder,&mdash;but I cannot,
and our doctor cannot help me to it,&mdash;and I
will not take the name of any disease in vain. However,
there is one consolation in being sick; and that
is the possibility that you may recover to a better
state than you were ever in before. I expected in the
winter to be deep in the woods of Maine in my
canoe, long before this; but I am so far from this
that I can only take a languid walk in Concord
streets.</p>

<p>I do not know how the mistake arose about the Cape
Cod excursion. The nearest I have come to that with
anybody is this: About a month ago Channing proposed
to me to go to Truro on Cape Cod with him,
and board there a while,&mdash;but I declined. For a week
past, however, I have been a little inclined to go there
and sit on the seashore a week or more; but I do not
venture to propose myself as the companion of him or
of any peripatetic man. Not that I should not rejoice
to have you and Brown or C. sitting there also. I am
not sure that C. really wishes to go now; and as I go
simply for the medicine of it, I should not think it
worth the while to notify him when I am about to take
my bitters. Since I began this, or within five minutes,
I have begun to think that I will start for Truro next
Saturday morning, the 30th. I do not know at what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
hour the packet leaves Boston, nor exactly what kind
of accommodation I shall find at Truro.</p>

<p>I should be singularly favored if you and Brown
were there at the same time; and though you speak of
the 20th of July, I will be so bold as to suggest your
coming to Concord Friday night (when, by the way,
Garrison and Phillips hold forth here), and going to
the Cape with me. Though we take short walks together
there, we can have <i>long</i> talks, and you and
Brown will have time enough for your own excursions
besides.</p>

<p>I received a letter from Cholmondeley last winter,
which I should like to show you, as well as his book.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>

He said that he had "accepted the offer of a captaincy
in the Salop Militia," and was hoping to take an active
part in the war before long.</p>

<p>I thank you again and again for the encouragement
your letters are to me. But I must stop this writing, or
I shall have to pay for it.</p>

<p class="address p2">
<span class="smcap">North Truro</span>, July 8, 1855.
</p>

<p>There being no packet, I did not leave Boston till
last Thursday, though I came down on Wednesday, and
Channing with me. There is no public house here; but
we are boarding in a little house attached to the Highland
Lighthouse with Mr. James Small, the keeper.
It is true the table is not so clean as could be desired,
but I have found it much superior in that respect to
a Provincetown hotel. They are what are called "good
livers." Our host has another larger and very good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
house, within a quarter of a mile, unoccupied, where
he says he can accommodate several more. He is a
very good man to deal with,&mdash;has often been the representative
of the town, and is perhaps the most intelligent
man in it. I shall probably stay here as much as
ten days longer. Board $3.50 per week. So you and
Brown had better come down forthwith. You will find
either the schooner Melrose or another, or both, leaving
Commerce Street, or else T Wharf, at 9 <span class="smcap">A. M.</span> (it commonly
means 10), Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays,&mdash;if
not other days. We left about 10 <span class="smcap">A. M.</span>, and
reached Provincetown at 5 <span class="smcap">P. M.</span>,&mdash;a very good run.
A stage runs up the Cape every morning but Sunday,
starting at 4½ <span class="smcap">A. M.</span>, and reaches the post-office in North
Truro, seven miles from Provincetown, and one from
the lighthouse, about 6 o'clock. If you arrive at P.
before night, you can walk over, and leave your baggage
to be sent. You can also come by cars from Boston
to Yarmouth, and thence by stage forty miles more,&mdash;through
every day, but it costs much more, and is
not so pleasant. Come by all means, for it is the best
place to see the ocean in the States.... I <i>hope</i> I shall
be worth meeting.</p>

<p class="address p2">
July 14.</p>

<p>You say that you hope I will excuse your frequent
writing. I trust you will excuse my infrequent and curt
writing until I am able to resume my old habits, which
for three months I have been compelled to abandon.
Methinks I am beginning to be better. I think to
leave the Cape next Wednesday, and so shall not see
you here; but I shall be glad to meet you in Concord,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
though I may not be able to go <i>before the mast</i>,
in a boating excursion. This is an admirable place
for coolness and sea-bathing and retirement. You must
come prepared for cool weather and fogs.</p>

<p>P. S.&mdash;There is no mail up till Monday morning.</p>

<p class="p2">During the spring and early summer of 1855, Thoreau
was much occupied with his home duties, or was
ill,&mdash;the earlier approaches of that disease of which he
languished, taking medical advice in 1860-61. This
must have prevented an earlier visit to Concord by his
friend Ricketson than September, 1855, and I find no
letters intervening, although there must have been one
or two, to arrange the visit. He reached Concord about
September 20, and found me living in the lower stories
of Channing's house, while the owner chiefly occupied
the attic, where, no doubt, as in the old Hunt house,
Ricketson smoked with him. They went together to
call on Edmund Hosmer, and it was at the sight of this
old house that Ricketson formed the plan of occupying
a chamber there. It stood a half-mile down the river,
a little below where the Assabet runs into the main
channel. Writing to Thoreau, Sunday, September 23,
Ricketson said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"How charmingly you, Channing, and I dovetailed
together! Few men smoke such pipes as we did,&mdash;the
real Calumet; the tobacco that we smoked was free
labor produce. I haven't lost sight of Solon Hosmer,
the wisest-looking man in Concord, and a real <i>feelosofer</i>.
I want you to see him, and tell him not to take
down the old house where the <i>feelosofers</i> met. I think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
I should like to have the large chamber for an occasional
sojourn in Concord. It can be easily tinkered up
so as to be a comfortable roost for a <i>feelosofer</i>,&mdash;a few
old chairs, a table, bed, etc., would be all-sufficient;
then you and Channing could come over in your punt
and rusticate."</p>

<p>The "punt" was Thoreau's boat, in which he sometimes
set up a small mast and sail, and which he kept
at the foot of Channing's garden, where, that summer,
my heavy four-oared boat also lay, when my pupils
were not rowing in it. In his letter to Blake of September
26, Thoreau described Ricketson, and the next
day he answered Ricketson's letter. Cholmondeley in
the meantime, the war being not yet over, was making
his way to the Crimea through southern Europe.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, September 26, 1855.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Blake</span>,&mdash;The other day I thought that my
health must be better,&mdash;that I gave at last a sign of
vitality,&mdash;because I experienced a slight chagrin. But
I do not see how strength is to be got into my legs
again. These months of feebleness have yielded few,
if any, thoughts, though they have not passed without
serenity, such as our sluggish Musketaquid suggests.
I hope that the harvest is to come. I trust that you
have at least warped up the stream a little daily, holding
fast by your anchors at night, since I saw you, and
have kept my place for me while I have been absent.</p>

<p>Mr. Ricketson of New Bedford has just made me a
visit of a day and a half, and I have had a quite good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
time with him. He and Channing have got on particularly
well together. He is a man of very simple tastes,
notwithstanding his wealth; a lover of nature; but,
above all, singularly frank and plain-spoken. I think
that you might enjoy meeting him.</p>

<p>Sincerity is a great but rare virtue, and we pardon
to it much complaining, and the betrayal of many
weaknesses. R. says of himself, that he sometimes
thinks that he has all the infirmities of genius without
the genius; is wretched without a hair pillow, etc.; expresses
a great and awful uncertainty with regard to
"God," "Death," his "immortality;" says, "If I only
knew," etc. He loves Cowper's "Task" better than
anything else; and thereafter perhaps, Thomson, Gray,
and even Howitt. He has evidently suffered for want of
sympathizing companions. He says that he sympathizes
with much in my books, but much in them is naught
to him,&mdash;"namby-pamby,"&mdash;"stuff,"&mdash;"mystical."
Why will not I, having common sense, write in plain
English always; <i>teach</i> men in detail how to live a
simpler life, etc.; not go off into &mdash;&mdash;? But I say
that I have no scheme about it,&mdash;no designs on men
at all; and, if I had, my mode would be to tempt
them with the fruit, and not with the manure. To what
end do I lead a simple life at all, pray? That I may
teach others to simplify their lives?&mdash;and so all our
lives be <i>simplified</i> merely, like an algebraic formula?
Or not, rather, that I may make use of the ground I
have cleared, to live more worthily and profitably? I
would fain lay the most stress forever on that which is
the most important,&mdash;imports the most to me,&mdash;though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
it were only (what it is likely to be) a vibration
in the air. As a preacher, I should be prompted to tell
men, not so much how to get their wheat bread cheaper,
as of the bread of life compared with which <i>that</i> is
bran. Let a man only taste these loaves, and he becomes
a skillful economist at once. He'll not waste
much time in earning those. Don't spend your time in
drilling soldiers, who may turn out hirelings after all,
but give to undrilled peasantry a <i>country</i> to fight for.
The schools begin with what they call the elements,
and where do they end?</p>

<p>I was glad to hear the other day that Higginson and
&mdash;&mdash; were gone to Ktaadn; it must be so much better
to go to than a Woman's Rights or Abolition Convention;
better still, to the delectable primitive mounts
within you, which you have dreamed of from your
youth up, and seen, perhaps, in the horizon, but never
climbed.</p>

<p>But how do <i>you</i> do? Is the air sweet to you? Do
you find anything at which you can work, accomplishing
something solid from day to day? Have you put sloth
and doubt behind, considerably?&mdash;had one redeeming
dream this summer? I dreamed, last night, that I could
vault over any height it pleased me. That was <i>something</i>;
and I contemplated myself with a slight satisfaction
in the morning for it.</p>

<p>Methinks I will write to you. Methinks you will be
glad to hear. We will stand on solid foundations to
one another,&mdash;I a column planted on this shore, you
on that. We meet the same sun in his rising. We
were built slowly, and have come to our bearing. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
will not mutually fall over that we may meet, but will
grandly and eternally guard the straits. Methinks I see
an inscription on you, which the architect made, the
stucco being worn off to it. The name of that ambitious
worldly king is crumbling away. I see it toward
sunset in favorable lights. Each must read for the other,
as might a sailer-by. Be sure you are star-y-pointing
still. How is it on your side? I will not require an
answer until you think I have paid my debts to you.</p>

<p>I have just got a letter from Ricketson, urging me
to come to New Bedford, which possibly I may do.
He says I can wear my old clothes there.</p>

<p>Let me be remembered in your quiet house.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO DANIEL RICKETSON (AT NEW BEDFORD).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, September 27, 1855.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Friend Ricketson</span>,&mdash;I am sorry that you were
obliged to leave Concord without seeing more of it,&mdash;its
river and woods, and various pleasant walks, and
its worthies. I assure you that I am none the worse
for my walk with you, but on all accounts the better.
Methinks I am regaining my health; but I would like
to know first what it was that ailed me.</p>

<p>I have not yet conveyed your message to Mr. Hosmer,<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>

but will not fail to do so. That idea of occupying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
the old house is a good one,&mdash;quite feasible,&mdash;and
you could bring your hair pillow with you. It is an <i>inn</i> in
Concord which I had not thought of,&mdash;a philosopher's
inn. That large chamber might make a man's idea
expand proportionately. It would be well to have an
interest in some old chamber in a deserted house in
every part of the country which attracted us. There
would be no such place to receive one's guests as that.
If old furniture is fashionable, why not go the whole
house at once? I shall endeavor to make Mr. Hosmer
believe that the old house is the chief attraction of his
farm, and that it is his duty to preserve it by all honest
appliances. You might take a lease of it <i>in perpetuo</i>,
and done with it.</p>

<p>I am so wedded to my way of spending a day,&mdash;require
such broad margins of leisure, and such a complete
wardrobe of old clothes,&mdash;that I am ill fitted for
going abroad. Pleasant is it sometimes to sit at home,
on a single egg all day, in your own nest, though it
may prove at last to be an egg of chalk. The old coat
that I wear is Concord; it is my morning robe and
study gown, my working dress and suit of ceremony, and
my nightgown after all. Cleave to the simplest ever.
Home,&mdash;home,&mdash;home. <i>Cars</i> sound like <i>cares</i> to me.</p>

<p>I am accustomed to think very long of going anywhere,&mdash;am
slow to move. I hope to hear a response
of the oracle first. However, I think that I will try
the effect of your talisman on the iron horse next Saturday,
and dismount at Tarkiln Hill. Perhaps your sea
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
air will be good for me. I conveyed your invitation to
Channing, but he apparently will not come.</p>

<p>Excuse my not writing earlier; but I had not decided.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO DANIEL RICKETSON (AT NEW BEDFORD).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, October 12, 1855.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Ricketson</span>,&mdash;I fear that you had a lonely and
disagreeable ride back to New Bedford through the
Carver woods and so on,&mdash;perhaps in the rain, too,
and I am in part answerable for it. I feel very much
in debt to you and your family for the pleasant days
I spent at Brooklawn. Tell Arthur and Walton<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
 that
the shells which they gave me are spread out, and
make quite a show to inland eyes. Methinks I still
hear the strains of the piano, the violin, and the flageolet
blended together. Excuse <i>me</i> for the noise which
I believe drove you to take refuge in the shanty. That
shanty is indeed a favorable place to expand in, which
I fear I did not enough improve.</p>

<p>On my way through Boston I inquired for Gilpin's
works at Little, Brown &amp; Co.'s, Munroe's, Ticknor's,
and Burnham's. They have not got them. They told
me at Little, Brown &amp; Co.'s that his works (not complete),
in twelve vols., 8vo, were imported and sold in
this country five or six years ago for about fifteen dollars.
Their terms for importing are ten per cent on
the cost. I copied from the "London Catalogue of
Books, 1846-51," at their shop, the following list of
Gilpin's Works:&mdash;

<p>Beside these, I remember to have read one volume
on "Prints;" his "Southern Tour" (1775); "Lakes
of Cumberland," two vols.; "Highlands of Scotland
and West of England," two vols.&mdash;<i>N. B.</i> There <i>must</i>
be plates in every volume.</p>

<p>I still see an image of those Middleborough ponds
in my mind's eye,&mdash;broad shallow lakes, with an
iron mine at the bottom,&mdash;comparatively unvexed by
sails,&mdash;only by Tom Smith and his squaw Sepit's
"sharper." I find my map of the State to be the best
I have seen of that district. It is a question whether
the islands of Long Pond or Great Quitticus offer the
greatest attractions to a Lord of the Isles. That plant
which I found on the shore of Long Pond chances to
be a rare and beautiful flower,&mdash;the <i>Sabbatia chloroides</i>,&mdash;referred
to Plymouth.</p>

<p>In a Description of Middleborough in the Hist. Coll.,
vol. iii, 1810, signed Nehemiah Bennet, Middleborough,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
1793, it is said: "There is on the easterly shore
of Assawampsitt Pond, on the shore of Betty's Neck,
two rocks which have curious marks thereon (supposed
to be done by the Indians), which appear like the steppings
of a person with naked feet which settled into
the rocks; likewise the prints of a hand on several
places, with a number of other marks; also there is a
rock on a high hill a little to the eastward of the old
stone fishing wear, where there is the print of a person's
hand in said rock."</p>

<p>It would be well to look at those rocks again more
carefully; also at the rock on the hill.</p>

<p>I should think that you would like to explore Snipatuit
Pond in Rochester,&mdash;it is so large and near.
It is an interesting fact that the alewives used to
ascend to it,&mdash;if they do not still,&mdash;both from Mattapoisett
and through Great Quitticus.</p>

<p>There will be no trouble about the chamber in the
old house, though, as I told you, Mr. Hosmer <i>may</i> expect
some compensation for it. He says, "Give my
respects to Mr. Ricketson, and tell him that I cannot
be at a large expense to preserve an antiquity or curiosity.
Nature must do its work." "But," says I, "he
asks you only not to assist nature."</p>

<p class="p2">It was on October 1 that Thoreau made this visit to
New Bedford, spending the best part of a week with
his friends there. They sailed about the bay and visited
the ponds in Middleborough, and on Saturday, October
6, he parted with Ricketson at Plymouth, and returned
home. At that time Ricketson proposed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
return Thoreau's visit before October 20, but, in a note
now lost, Thoreau sent him word that Channing had
left Concord, "perhaps for the winter." The visit
was then given up,&mdash;which accounts for the tone of
Thoreau's next letter, of October 16.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO DANIEL RICKETSON (AT NEW BEDFORD).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, October 16, 1855.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Friend Ricketson</span>,&mdash;I have got both your letters
at once. You must not think Concord so barren a
place when Channing<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
 is away. There are the river
and fields left yet; and I, though ordinarily a man of
business, should have some afternoons and evenings to
spend with you, I trust,&mdash;that is, if you could stand
so much of me. If you can spend your time profitably
here, or without <i>ennui</i>, having an occasional ramble or
<i>tête-à-tête</i> with one of the natives, it will give me pleasure
to have you in the neighborhood. You see I am
preparing you for our awful unsocial ways,&mdash;keeping
in our dens a good part of the day,&mdash;sucking our claws
perhaps. But then we make a religion of it, and that
you cannot but respect.</p>

<p>If you know the taste of your own heart, and like it,
come to Concord, and I'll warrant you enough here
to season the dish with,&mdash;aye, even though Channing
and Emerson and I were all away. We might paddle
quietly up the river. Then there are one or two more
ponds to be seen, etc.</p>

<p>I should very much enjoy further rambling with you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
in your vicinity, but must postpone it for the present.
To tell the truth, I am planning to get seriously to
work after these long months of inefficiency and idleness.
I do not know whether you are haunted by any
such demon which puts you on the alert to pluck the
fruit of each day as it passes, and store it safely in
your bin. True, it is well to live abandonedly from
time to time; but to our working hours that must be
as the spile to the bung. So for a long season I must
enjoy only a low slanting gleam in my mind's eye from
the Middleborough ponds far away.</p>

<p>Methinks I am getting a little more strength into
those knees of mine; and, for my part, I believe that
God <i>does</i> delight in the strength of a man's legs.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, December 9, 1855.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Blake</span>,&mdash;Thank you! thank you for going
a-wooding with me,&mdash;and enjoying it,&mdash;for being
warmed by my wood fire. I have indeed enjoyed it
much alone. I see how I might enjoy it yet more with
company,&mdash;how we might help each other to live.
And to be admitted to Nature's hearth costs nothing.
None is excluded, but excludes himself. You have only
to push aside the curtain.</p>

<p>I am glad to hear that you were there too. There
are many more such voyages, and longer ones, to be
made on that river, for it is the water of life. The
Ganges is nothing to it. Observe its reflections,&mdash;no
idea but is familiar to it. That river, though to dull
eyes it seems terrestrial wholly, flows through Elysium.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
What powers bathe in it invisible to villagers! Talk of
its shallowness,&mdash;that hay-carts can be driven through
it at midsummer; its depth passeth my understanding.
If, forgetting the allurements of the world, I could
drink deeply enough of it; if, cast adrift from the shore,
I could with complete integrity float on it, I should
never be seen on the Mill-Dam again.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
 If there is any
depth in me, there is a corresponding depth in it. It
is the cold blood of the gods. I paddle and bathe in
their artery.</p>

<p>I do not want a stick of wood for so trivial a use as
to burn even, but they get it overnight, and carve and
gild it that it may please my eye. What persevering
lovers they are! What infinite pains to attract and delight
us! They will supply us with fagots wrapped in
the daintiest packages, and freight paid; sweet-scented
woods, and bursting into flower, and resounding as if
Orpheus had just left them,&mdash;these shall be our fuel,
and we still prefer to chaffer with the wood-merchant!</p>

<p>The jug we found still stands draining bottom up on
the bank, on the sunny side of the house. That river,&mdash;who
shall say exactly whence it came, and whither
it goes? Does aught that flows come from a higher
source? Many things drift downward on its surface
which would enrich a man. If you could only be on
the alert all day, and every day! And the nights are
as long as the days.</p>

<p>Do you not think you could contrive thus to get
woody fibre enough to bake your wheaten bread with?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
Would you not perchance have tasted the sweet crust
of another kind of bread in the meanwhile, which ever
hangs ready baked on the bread-fruit trees of the
world?</p>

<p>Talk of burning your smoke after the wood has been
consumed! There is a far more important and warming
heat, commonly lost, which precedes the burning
of the wood. It is the smoke of industry, which is incense.
I had been so thoroughly warmed in body and
spirit, that when at length my fuel was housed, I came
near selling it to the ash-man, as if I had extracted all
its heat.</p>

<p>You should have been here to help me get in my
boat. The last time I used it, November 27th, paddling
up the Assabet, I saw a great round pine log
sunk deep in the water, and with labor got it aboard.
When I was floating this home so gently, it occurred
to me why I had found it. It was to make wheels with
to roll my boat into winter quarters upon. So I sawed
off two thick rollers from one end, pierced them for
wheels, and then of a joist which I had found drifting
on the river in the summer I made an axletree, and on
this I rolled my boat out.</p>

<p>Miss Mary Emerson<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
 is here,&mdash;the youngest person
in Concord, though about eighty,&mdash;and the most apprehensive
of a genuine thought; earnest to know of
your inner life; most stimulating society; and exceedingly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
witty withal. She says they called her old when
she was young, and she has never grown any older.
I wish you could see her.</p>

<p>My books<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
 did not arrive till November 30th, the
cargo of the Asia having been complete when they
reached Liverpool. I have arranged them in a case
which I made in the meanwhile, partly of river boards.
I have not dipped far into the new ones yet. One is
splendidly bound and illuminated. They are in English,
French, Latin, Greek, and Sanscrit. I have not
made out the significance of this godsend yet.</p>

<p>Farewell, and bright dreams to you!</p>

<p class="center p2">TO DANIEL RICKETSON (AT NEW BEDFORD).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, December 25, 1855.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Friend Ricketson</span>,&mdash;Though you have not shown
your face here, I trust that you did not interpret my
last note to my disadvantage. I remember that, among
other things, I wished to break it to you, that, owing to
engagements, I should not be able to show you so much
attention as I could wish, or as you had shown to me.
How we did scour over the country! I hope your horse
will live as long as one which I hear just died in the
south of France at the age of forty. Yet I had no doubt
you would get quite enough of me. Do not give it up
so easily. The old house is still empty, and Hosmer is
easy to treat with.</p>

<p>Channing was here about ten days ago. I told him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
of my visit to you, and that he too must go and see
you and your country.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
 This may have suggested his
writing to you.</p>

<p>That island lodge, especially for some weeks in a
summer, and new explorations in your vicinity, are
certainly very alluring; but <i>such are my engagements to
myself</i>, that I dare not promise to wend your way, but
will for the present only heartily thank you for your
kind and generous offer. When my vacation comes,
then look out.</p>

<p>My legs have grown considerably stronger, and that
is all that ails me.</p>

<p>But I wish now above all to inform you,&mdash;though I
suppose you will not be particularly interested,&mdash;that
Cholmondeley has gone to the Crimea, "a complete
soldier," with a design, when he returns, if he ever returns,
to buy a cottage in the South of England, and
tempt me over; but that, before going, he busied himself
in buying, and has caused to be forwarded to me
by Chapman, a royal gift, in the shape of twenty-one
distinct works (one in nine volumes,&mdash;forty-four volumes
in all), almost exclusively relating to ancient
Hindoo literature, and scarcely one of them to be
bought in America.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
 I am familiar with many of them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
and know how to prize them. I send you information
of this as I might of the birth of a child.</p>

<p>Please remember me to all your family.</p>

<p class="p2">On the date of Thoreau's letter of December 25,
1855, another event occurred, of some note in these
annals of friendship. Channing, from his Dorchester
abode, suddenly showed himself at Ricketson's door.
"I had just written his name when old Ranger announced
him.... He arrived on Christmas day" (as
Thoreau had done the year before) "and his first
salutation on meeting me at the front door of my house
was, 'That's your shanty,' pointing towards it. He is
engaged with the editor of the N. B. <i>Mercury</i>, and
boards in town, but whereabout I have not yet [February
26, 1856] discovered. He usually spends Saturday
and a part of Sunday with me." In replying to this
information, Thoreau gives that admirable character of
his poet neighbor which has often been quoted.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">TO DANIEL RICKETSON (AT NEW BEDFORD).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, March 5, 1856.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Friend Ricketson</span>,&mdash;I have been out of town,
else I should have acknowledged your letter before.
Though not in the best mood for writing, I will say
what I can now. You plainly have a rare, though a
cheap, resource in your shanty. Perhaps the time will
come when every country-seat will have one,&mdash;when
every country-seat will <i>be one</i>. I would advise you to
see that shanty business out, though you go shanty-mad.
Work your vein till it is exhausted, or conducts
you to a broader one; so that Channing shall stand
before your shanty, and say, "That is your house."</p>

<p>This has indeed been a grand winter for me, and
for all of us. I am not considering how much I have
enjoyed it. What matters it how happy or unhappy
we have been, if we have minded our business and
advanced our affairs? I have made it a part of my
business to wade in the snow and take the measure of
the ice. The ice on one of our ponds was just two feet
thick on the first of March; and I have to-day been
surveying a wood-lot, where I sank about two feet at
every step.</p>

<p>It is high time that you, fanned by the warm breezes
of the Gulf Stream, had begun to "<i>lay</i>" for even the
Concord hens have, though one wonders where they
find the raw material of egg-shell here. Beware how
you put off your laying to any later spring, else your
cackling will not have the inspiring early spring sound.</p>

<p>I was surprised to hear the other day that Channing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
was in New Bedford. When he was here last (in December,
I think), he said, like himself, in answer to my
inquiry where he lived, "that he did not know the
name of the place;" so it has remained in a degree of
obscurity to me. As you have made it certain to me
that he is in New Bedford, perhaps I can return the
favor by putting you on the track to his boarding-house
there. Mrs. Arnold told Mrs. Emerson where it was;
and the latter thinks, though she may be mistaken,
that it was at a Mrs. Lindsay's.</p>

<p>I am rejoiced to hear that you are getting on so
bravely with him and his verses. He and I, as you
know, have been old cronies,<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><p class="o1">"Fed the same flock, by fountain, shade, and rill,</p>
<p>Together both, ere the high lawns appeared</p>
<p>Under the opening eyelids of the morn,</p>
<p>We drove afield, and both together heared," etc.</p></div></div>

<p>"But O, the heavy change," now he is gone. The
Channing you have seen and described is the real
Simon Pure. You have seen him. Many a good ramble
may you have together! You will see in him still
more of the same kind to attract and to puzzle you.
How to serve him most effectually has long been a problem
with his friends. Perhaps it is left for you to solve
it. I suspect that the most that you or any one can
do for him is to appreciate his genius,&mdash;to buy and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
read, and cause others to buy and read, his poems. That
is the hand which he has put forth to the world,&mdash;take
hold of that. Review them if you can,&mdash;perhaps
take the risk of publishing something more which he
may write. Your knowledge of Cowper will help you
to know Channing. He will accept sympathy and aid,
but he will not bear questioning, unless the aspects of
the sky are particularly auspicious. He will ever be
"reserved and enigmatic," and you must deal with
him at arm's length.</p>

<p>I have no secrets to tell you concerning him, and
do not wish to call obvious excellences and defects by
far-fetched names. I think I have already spoken to
you more, and more to the purpose, on this theme,
than I am likely to write now; nor need I suggest
how witty and poetic he is, and what an inexhaustible
fund of good fellowship you will find in him.</p>

<p>As for visiting you in April, though I am inclined
enough to take some more rambles in your neighborhood,
especially by the seaside, I dare not engage myself,
nor allow you to expect me. The truth is, I have
my enterprises now as ever, at which I tug with ridiculous
feebleness, but admirable perseverance, and cannot
say when I shall be sufficiently fancy-free for such an
excursion.</p>

<p>You have done well to write a lecture on Cowper.
In the expectation of getting you to read it here, I
applied to the curators of our Lyceum;<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
 but, alas, our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
Lyceum has been a failure this winter for want of
funds. It ceased some weeks since, with a debt, they
tell me, to be carried over to the next year's account.
Only one more lecture is to be read by a Signor Somebody,
an Italian, paid for by private subscription, as
a deed of charity to the lecturer. They are not rich
enough to offer you your expenses even, though probably
a month or two ago they would have been glad
of the chance.</p>

<p>However, the old house has not failed yet. That
offers you lodging for an indefinite time after you get
into it; and in the meanwhile I offer you bed and
board in my father's house,&mdash;always excepting hair
pillows and new-fangled bedding.</p>

<p>Remember me to your family.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, March 13, 1856.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Blake</span>,&mdash;It is high time I sent you a word. I
have not heard from Harrisburg since offering to go
there, and have not been invited to lecture anywhere
else the past winter. So you see I am fast growing
rich. This is quite right, for such is my relation to the
lecture-goers, I should be surprised and alarmed if
there were any great call for me. I confess that I am
considerably alarmed even when I hear that an individual
wishes to meet me, for my experience teaches
me that we shall thus only be made certain of a mutual
strangeness, which otherwise we might never have been
aware of.</p>

<p>I have not yet recovered strength enough for such a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
walk as you propose, though pretty well again for circumscribed
rambles and chamber work. Even now, I
am probably the greatest walker in Concord,&mdash;to its
disgrace be it said. I remember our walks and talks
and sailing in the past with great satisfaction, and trust
that we shall have more of them ere long,&mdash;have more
woodings-up,&mdash;for even in the spring we must still seek
"fuel to maintain our fires."</p>

<p>As you suggest, we would fain value one another for
what we are absolutely, rather than relatively. How
will this do for a symbol of sympathy?</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i-321" id="i-321"></a>
<img src="images/i-321.jpg" width="220" height="97" alt="" />
</div>

<p>As for compliments, even the stars praise me, and I
praise them. They and I sometimes belong to a mutual
admiration society. Is it not so with you? I know
you of old. Are you not tough and earnest to be talked
at, praised, or blamed? Must <i>you</i> go out of the room
because you are the subject of conversation? Where
will you go to, pray? Shall we look into the "Letter
Writer" to see what compliments are admissible? I
am not afraid of praise, for I have practiced it on
myself. As for my deserts, I never took an account of
that stock, and in this connection care not whether I
am deserving or not. When I hear praise coming, do I
not elevate and arch myself to hear it like the sky, and
as impersonally? Think I appropriate any of it to my
weak legs? No. Praise away <i>till all is blue</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span></p>

<p>I see by the newspapers that the season for making
sugar is at hand. Now is the time, whether you be
rock, or white maple, or hickory. I trust that you have
prepared a store of sap-tubs and sumach spouts, and
invested largely in kettles. Early the first frosty morning,
tap your maples,&mdash;the sap will not run in summer,
you know. It matters not how little juice you get,
if you get all you can, and boil it down. I made just
one crystal of sugar once, one twentieth of an inch
cube, out of a pumpkin, and it sufficed. Though the
yield be no greater than that, this is not less the season
for it, and it will be not the less sweet, nay, it will be
infinitely the sweeter.</p>

<p>Shall, then, the maple yield sugar, and not man?
Shall the farmer be thus active, and surely have so
much sugar to show for it, before this very March is
gone,&mdash;while I read the newspaper? While he works
in his sugar-camp let me work in mine,&mdash;for sweetness
is in me, and to sugar it shall come,&mdash;it shall not
all go to leaves and wood. Am I not a <i>sugar maple</i>
man, then? Boil down the sweet sap which the spring
causes to flow within you. Stop not at syrup,&mdash;go on
to sugar, though you present the world with but a
single crystal,&mdash;a crystal not made from trees in your
yard, but from the new life that stirs in your pores.
Cheerfully skim your kettle, and watch it set and
crystallize, making a holiday of it if you will. Heaven
will be propitious to you as to him.</p>

<p>Say to the farmer: There is your crop; here is mine.
Mine is a sugar to sweeten sugar with. If you will listen
to me, I will sweeten your whole load,&mdash;your whole life.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span></p>

<p>Then will the callers ask, Where is Blake? He is in
his sugar-camp on the mountainside. Let the world
await him. Then will the little boys bless you, and the
great boys too, for such sugar is the origin of many
condiments,&mdash;Blakians in the shops of Worcester, of
new form, with their mottoes wrapped up in them.
Shall men taste only the sweetness of the maple and
the cane the coming year?</p>

<p>A walk over the crust to Asnebumskit, standing
there in its inviting simplicity, is tempting to think of,&mdash;making
a fire on the snow under some rock! The very
poverty of outward nature implies an inward wealth in
the walker. What a Golconda is he conversant with,
thawing his fingers over such a blaze! But&mdash;but&mdash;</p>

<p>Have you read the new poem, "The Angel in the
House"? Perhaps you will find it good for you.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, May 21, 1856.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Blake</span>,&mdash;I have not for a long time been <i>putting
such thoughts together</i> as I should like to read to
the company you speak of. I have enough of that sort
to say, or even read, but not time now to arrange it.
Something I have prepared might prove for their entertainment
or refreshment perchance; but I would not
like to have a hat carried round for it. I have just
been reading some papers to see if they would do for
your company; but though I thought pretty well of
them as long as I read them to myself, when I got an
auditor to try them on, I felt that they would not answer.
How could I let you drum up a company to hear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
them? In fine, what I have is either too scattered or
loosely arranged, or too light, or else is too scientific
and matter-of-fact (I run a good deal into that of late)
for so hungry a company.</p>

<p>I am still a learner, not a teacher, feeding somewhat
omnivorously, browsing both stalk and leaves; but I
shall perhaps be enabled to speak with the more precision
and authority by and by,&mdash;if philosophy and
sentiment are not buried under a multitude of details.</p>

<p>I do not refuse, but accept your invitation, only
changing the time. I consider myself invited to Worcester
once for all, and many thanks to the inviter. As
for the Harvard excursion,<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
 will you let me suggest
another? Do you and Brown come to Concord on
Saturday, if the weather promises well, and spend the
Sunday here on the river or hills, or both. So we shall
save some of our money (which is of next importance
to our souls), and lose&mdash;I do not know what. You
say you <i>talked</i> of coming here before; now <i>do</i> it. I do
not propose this because I think that I am worth your
spending time with, but because I hope that we may
prove flint and steel to one another. It is at most only
an hour's ride farther, and you can at any rate do what
you please when you get here.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span></p>

<p>Then we will see if we have any apology to offer for
our existence. So come to Concord,&mdash;come to Concord,&mdash;come
to Concord! or&mdash;your suit shall be defaulted.</p>

<p>As for the dispute about solitude and society, any
comparison is impertinent. It is an idling down on
the plane at the base of a mountain, instead of climbing
steadily to its top. Of course you will be glad of
all the society you can get to go up with. Will you go
to glory with me? is the burden of the song. I love
society so much that I swallowed it all at a gulp,&mdash;that
is, all that came in my way. It is not that we love
to be alone, but that we love to soar, and when we do
soar, the company grows thinner and thinner till there
is none at all. It is either the <i>Tribune</i><a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
 on the plain,
a sermon on the mount, or a very private ecstasy still
higher up. We are not the less to aim at the summits,
though the multitude does not ascend them. Use all
the society that will abet you. But perhaps I do not
enter into the spirit of your talk.</p>

<p class="p2">In the spring of 1856, Mr. Alcott, then living in
Walpole, N. H., visited Concord, and while there suggested
to Thoreau that the upper valley of the Connecticut,
in which Walpole lies, was good walking-ground,
and that he would be glad to see him there. When
autumn began to hover in the distance, Thoreau recalled
this invitation, and sent the letter below.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">TO BRONSON ALCOTT (AT WALPOLE, N. H.).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, September 1, 1856.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Alcott</span>,&mdash;I remember that, in the spring, you
invited me to visit you. I feel inclined to spend a day
or two with you and on your hills at this season, returning,
perhaps, by way of Brattleboro. What if I
should take the cars for Walpole next Friday morning?
Are you at home? And will it be convenient and
agreeable to you to see me then? I will await an
answer.</p>

<p>I am but poor company, and it will not be worth the
while to put yourself out on my account; yet from time
to time I have some thoughts which would be the better
for an airing. I also wish to get some hints from
September on the Connecticut to help me understand
that season on the Concord; to snuff the musty fragrance
of the decaying year in the primitive woods.
There is considerable cellar-room in my nature for
such stores; a whole row of bins waiting to be filled,
before I can celebrate my Thanksgiving. Mould is the
richest of soils, yet <i>I</i> am not mould. It will always be
found that one flourishing institution exists and battens
on another mouldering one. The Present itself is parasitic
to this extent.</p>

<p class="left45">
Your fellow-traveler,<br />
<span class="smcap i4">Henry D. Thoreau</span>.</p>

<p>As fortune would have it, Mr. Alcott was then making
his arrangements for a conversational tour in the
vicinity of New York; but he renewed the invitation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
for himself, while repeating it in the name of Mrs.
Alcott and his daughters. Thoreau made the visit, I
believe, and some weeks later, at the suggestion of Mr.
Alcott, he was asked by Marcus Spring of New York
to give lectures and survey their estate for a community
at Perth Amboy, N. J., in which Mr. Spring
and his friends, the Birneys, Welds, Grimkés, etc., had
united for social and educational purposes. It was a
colony of radical opinions and old-fashioned culture;
the Grimkés having been bred in Charleston, S. C.,
which they left by reason of their opposition to negro
slavery, and the elder Birney having held slaves in
Alabama until his conscience bade him emancipate
them, after which he, too, could have no secure home
among slaveholders. He was the first presidential candidate
of the voting Abolitionists, as Lincoln was the
last; and his friend, Theodore Weld, who married Miss
Grimké, had been one of the early apostles of emancipation
in Ohio. Their circle at Eagleswood appealed
to Thoreau's sense of humor, and is described by him
in a letter soon to be given.</p>

<p class="p2">In June, 1856, Thoreau made a long visit at Brooklawn.
In August, Mr. Ricketson, who had proposed a
summer visit to Concord, found himself prevented by
feeble health, and received the two following letters
from Thoreau:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">TO DANIEL RICKETSON (AT NEW BEDFORD).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, September 2, 1856.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Friend Ricketson</span>,&mdash;My father and mother regret
that your indisposition is likely to prevent your coming
to Concord at present. It is as well that you do not, if
you depend on seeing me, for I expect to go to New
Hampshire the latter part of the week. I shall be glad
to see you afterward, if you are prepared for and can
endure my unsocial habits.</p>

<p>I would suggest that you have one or two of the teeth
which you can best spare extracted at once, for the
sake of your general, no less than particular health.
This is the advice of one who has had quite his share
of toothache in this world. I am a trifle stouter than
when I saw you last, yet far, far short of my best estate.</p>

<p>I thank you for two newspapers which you have sent
me; am glad to see that you have studied out the history
of the ponds, got the Indian names straightened,&mdash;which
means made more crooked,&mdash;etc., etc. I remember
them with great satisfaction. They are all the
more interesting to me for the lean and sandy soil that
surrounds them. Heaven is not one of your fertile
Ohio bottoms, you may depend on it. Ah, the Middleborough
ponds!&mdash;Great Platte lakes. Remember me
to the perch in them. I trust that I may have some
better craft than that oarless pumpkin-seed<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
 the next
time I navigate them.</p>

<p>From the size of your family I infer that Mrs. Ricketson
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
and your daughters have returned from Franconia.
Please remember me to them, and also to Arthur and
Walton; and tell the latter that if, in the course of his
fishing, he should chance to come across the shell of a
terrapin, and will save it for me, I shall be exceedingly
obliged to him.</p>

<p>Channing dropped in on us the other day, but soon
dropped out again.</p>

<p class="address p2">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, September 23, 1856.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Friend Ricketson</span>,&mdash;I have returned from New
Hampshire, and find myself <i>in statu quo</i>. My journey
proved one of business purely. As you suspected, I saw
Alcott, and I spoke to him of you, and your good will
toward him; so now you may consider yourself introduced.
He would be glad to hear from you about a
conversation in New Bedford. He was about setting
out on a conversing tour to Fitchburg, Worcester, and,
three or four weeks hence, Waterbury, Ct., New York,
Newport (?) or Providence (?). You may be sure that
you will not have occasion to repent of any exertions
which you may make to secure an audience for him. I
send you one of his programmes, lest he should not
have done so himself.</p>

<p>You propose to me teaching the following winter. I
find that I cannot entertain the idea. It would require
such a revolution of all my habits, I think, and would
sap the very foundations of me. I am engaged to Concord
and my own private pursuits by 10,000 ties, and
it would be suicide to rend them. If I were weaker,
and not somewhat stronger, physically, I should be
more tempted. I am so busy that I cannot even think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
of visiting you. The days are not long enough, or I am
not strong enough to do the work of the day, before
bedtime.</p>

<p>Excuse my paper. It chances to be the best I have.</p>

<p class="p2">In October, 1856, Mr. Spring, whom Mr. Alcott was
then visiting, wrote to Thoreau inviting him to come
to Eagleswood, give lectures, and survey two hundred
acres of land belonging to the community, laying out
streets and making a map of the proposed village.
Thoreau accepted the proposal, and soon after wrote
the following letter, which Miss Thoreau submitted to
Mr. Emerson for publication, with other letters, in the
volume of 1865; but he returned it, inscribed, "Not
printable at present." The lapse of time has removed
this objection.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO SOPHIA THOREAU.</p>

<p class="center s08">
[Direct] <span class="smcap">Eagleswood, Perth Amboy</span>, N. J.,</p>

<p class="address">Saturday eve, November 1, 1856.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sophia</span>,&mdash;I have hardly had time and repose
enough to write to you before. I spent the afternoon
of Friday (it seems some months ago) in Worcester,
but failed to see [Harrison] Blake, he having "gone to
the horse-race" in Boston; to atone for which I have
just received a letter from him, asking me to stop at
Worcester and lecture on my return. I called on
[Theo.] Brown and [T. W.] Higginson; in the evening
came by way of Norwich to New York in the steamer
Commonwealth, and, though it was so windy inland,
had a perfectly smooth passage, and about as good a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
sleep as usually at home. Reached New York about
seven <span class="smcap">A. M.</span>, too late for the John Potter (there was n't
any Jonas), so I spent the forenoon there, called on
Greeley (who was not in), met [F. A. T.] Bellew in
Broadway and walked into his workshop, read at the
Astor Library, etc. I arrived here, about thirty miles
from New York, about five <span class="smcap">P. M.</span> Saturday, in company
with Miss E. Peabody, who was returning in the same
covered wagon from the Landing to Eagleswood, which
last place she has just left for the winter.</p>

<p>This is a queer place. There is one large long stone
building, which cost some forty thousand dollars, in
which I do not know exactly who or how many work
(one or two familiar places and more familiar names
have turned up), a few shops and offices, an old farmhouse,
and Mr. Spring's perfectly private residence,
within twenty rods of the main building. The city of
Perth Amboy is about as big as Concord, and Eagleswood
is one and a quarter miles southwest of it, on the
Bay side. The central fact here is evidently Mr. [Theodore]
Weld's school, recently established, around which
various other things revolve. Saturday evening I went to
the schoolroom, hall, or what not, to see the children and
their teachers and patrons dance. Mr. Weld, a kind-looking
man with a long white beard, danced with
them, and Mr. [E. J.] Cutler, his assistant (lately from
Cambridge, who is acquainted with Sanborn), Mr.
Spring, and others. This Saturday evening dance is a
regular thing, and it is thought something strange if
you don't attend. They take it for granted that you
want society!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span></p>

<p>Sunday forenoon I attended a sort of Quaker meeting
at the same place (the Quaker aspect and spirit
prevail here,&mdash;Mrs. Spring says, "Does thee not?"),
where it was expected that the Spirit would move me
(I having been previously spoken to about it); and it,
or something else, did,&mdash;an inch or so. I said just
enough to set them a little by the ears and make it
lively. I had excused myself by saying that I could
not adapt myself to a particular audience; for all the
speaking and lecturing here have reference to the children,
who are far the greater part of the audience, and
they are not so bright as New England children. Imagine
them sitting close to the wall, all around a hall,
with old Quaker-looking men and women here and
there. There sat Mrs. Weld [Grimké] and her sister,
two elderly gray-headed ladies, the former in extreme
Bloomer costume, which was what you may call remarkable;
Mr. Arnold Buffum, with broad face and a
great white beard, looking like a pier-head made of the
cork-tree with the bark on, as if he could buffet a considerable
wave; James G. Birney, formerly candidate
for the presidency, with another particularly white head
and beard; Edward Palmer, the anti-money man (for
whom communities were made), with his ample beard
somewhat grayish. Some of them, I suspect, are very
worthy people. Of course you are wondering to what
extent all these make one family, and to what extent
twenty. Mrs. Kirkland<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
 (and this a name only to me)
I saw. She has just bought a lot here. They all know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
more about your neighbors and acquaintances than
you suspected.</p>

<p>On Monday evening I read the moose story to the
children, to their satisfaction. Ever since I have been
constantly engaged in surveying Eagleswood,&mdash;through
woods, salt marshes, and along the shore, dodging the
tide, through bushes, mud, and beggar-ticks, having no
time to look up or think where I am. (It takes ten or
fifteen minutes before each meal to pick the beggar-ticks
out of my clothes; burs and the rest are left,
and rents mended at the first convenient opportunity.)
I shall be engaged perhaps as much longer. Mr. Spring
wants me to help him about setting out an orchard and
vineyard, Mr. Birney asks me to survey a small piece
for him, and Mr. Alcott, who has just come down here
for the third Sunday, says that Greeley (I left my
name for him) invites him and me to go to his home
with him next Saturday morning and spend the Sunday.</p>

<p>It seems a twelvemonth since I was not here, but I
hope to get settled deep into my den again ere long.
The hardest thing to find here is solitude&mdash;and Concord.
I am at Mr. Spring's house. Both he and she
and their family are quite agreeable.</p>

<p>I want you to write to me immediately (just left off
to talk French with the servant man), and let father
and mother put in a word. To them and to Aunts,
love from</p>

<p class="left65">
<span class="smcap">Henry</span>.</p>

<p>The date of this visit to Eagleswood is worthy of
note, because in that November Thoreau made the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
acquaintance of the late Walt Whitman, in whom he
ever after took a deep interest. Accompanied by Mr.
Alcott, he called on Whitman, then living at Brooklyn;
and I remember the calm enthusiasm with which they
both spoke of Whitman upon their return to Concord.
"Three men," said Emerson, in his funeral eulogy of
Thoreau, "have of late years strongly impressed Mr.
Thoreau,&mdash;John Brown, his Indian guide in Maine,
Joe Polis, and a third person, not known to this audience."
This last was Whitman, who has since become
well known to a larger audience.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Eagleswood</span>, N. J., November 19, 1856.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Blake</span>,&mdash;I have been here much longer than I
expected, but have deferred answering you, because I
could not foresee when I should return. I do not know
yet within three or four days. This uncertainty makes
it impossible for me to appoint a day to meet you, until
it should be too late to hear from you again. I think,
therefore, that I must go straight home. I feel some
objection to reading that "What shall it profit" lecture
again in Worcester; but if you are quite sure that it
will be worth the while (it is a grave consideration), I
will even make an independent journey from Concord
for that purpose. I have read three of my old lectures
(that included) to the Eagleswood people, and, unexpectedly,
with rare success,&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, I was aware that
what I was saying was silently taken in by their ears.</p>

<p>You must excuse me if I write mainly a business
letter now, for I am sold for the time,&mdash;am merely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
Thoreau the surveyor here,&mdash;and solitude is scarcely
obtainable in these parts.</p>

<p>Alcott has been here three times, and, Saturday before
last, I went with him and Greeley, by invitation
of the last, to G.'s farm, thirty-six miles north of New
York. The next day A. and I heard Beecher preach;
and what was more, we visited Whitman the next
morning (A. had already seen him), and were much
interested and provoked. He is apparently the greatest
democrat the world has seen. Kings and aristocracy
go by the board at once, as they have long deserved to.
A remarkably strong though coarse nature, of a sweet
disposition, and much prized by his friends. Though
peculiar and rough in his exterior, his skin (all over (?))
red, he is essentially a gentleman. I am still somewhat
in a quandary about him,&mdash;feel that he is essentially
strange to me, at any rate; but I am surprised by the
sight of him. He is very broad, but, as I have said,
not fine. He said that I misapprehended him. I am
not quite sure that I do. He told us that he loved to
ride up and down Broadway all day on an omnibus,
sitting beside the driver, listening to the roar of the
carts, and sometimes gesticulating and declaiming Homer
at the top of his voice. He has long been an editor
and writer for the newspapers,&mdash;was editor of the
<i>New Orleans Crescent</i> once; but now has no employment
but to read and write in the forenoon, and walk
in the afternoon, like all the rest of the scribbling
gentry.</p>

<p>I shall probably be in Concord next week; so you
can direct to me there.

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Blake</span>,&mdash;I trust that you got a note from me
at Eagleswood, about a fortnight ago. I passed through
Worcester on the morning of the 25th of November,
and spent several hours (from 3.30 to 6.20) in the
travelers' room at the depot, as in a dream, it now
seems. As the first Harlem train unexpectedly connected
with the first from Fitchburg, I did not spend
the forenoon with you as I had anticipated, on account
of baggage, etc. If it had been a seasonable hour, I
should have seen you,&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, if you had not gone to a
horse-race. But think of making a call at half past
three in the morning! (would it not have implied a
three-o'clock-in-the-morning courage in both you and
me?) as it were, ignoring the fact that mankind are
really not at home,&mdash;are not out, but so deeply in
that they cannot be seen,&mdash;nearly half their hours at
this season of the year.</p>

<p>I walked up and down the main street, at half past
five, in the dark, and paused long in front of Brown's
store, trying to distinguish its features; considering
whether I might safely leave his <i>Putnam</i> in the door-handle,
but concluded not to risk it. Meanwhile
a watchman (?) seemed to be watching me, and I
moved off. Took another turn around there, and had
the very earliest offer of the <i>Transcript</i><a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
 from an urchin
behind, whom I actually could not see, it was so
dark. So I withdrew, wondering if you and B. would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
know if I had been there. You little dream who is
occupying Worcester when you are all asleep. Several
things occurred there that night which I will venture to
say were not put into the <i>Transcript</i>. A cat caught a
mouse at the depot, and gave it to her kitten to play
with. So that world-famous tragedy goes on by night
as well as by day, and nature is <i>emphatically</i> wrong.
Also I saw a young Irishman kneel before his mother,
as if in prayer, while she wiped a cinder out of his eye
with her tongue; and I found that it was never too
late (or early?) to learn something. These things transpired
while you and B. were, to all practical purposes,
nowhere, and good for nothing,&mdash;not even for society,&mdash;not
for horse-races,&mdash;nor the taking back of a
<i>Putnam's Magazine</i>. It is true, I might have recalled
you to life, but it would have been a cruel act,
considering the kind of life you would have come
back to.</p>

<p>However, I would fain write to you now by broad
daylight, and report to you some of my life, such as it
is, and recall you to your life, which is not always lived
by you, even by daylight. Blake! Brown! are you
awake? are you aware what an ever-glorious morning
this is,&mdash;what long-expected, never-to-be-repeated opportunity
is now offered to get life and knowledge?</p>

<p>For my part, I am trying to wake up,&mdash;to wring
slumber out of my pores; for, generally, I take events
as unconcernedly as a fence-post,&mdash;absorb wet and
cold like it, and am pleasantly tickled with lichens
slowly spreading over me. Could I not be content,
then, to be a cedar post, which lasts twenty-five years?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
Would I not rather be that than the farmer that set it?
or he that preaches to the farmer? and go to the
heaven of posts at last? I think I should like that as
well as any would like it. But I should not care if I
sprouted into a living tree, put forth leaves and flowers,
and bore fruit.</p>

<p>I am grateful for what I am and have. My thanksgiving
is perpetual. It is surprising how contented one
can be with nothing definite,&mdash;only a sense of existence.
Well, anything for variety. I am ready to try this for
the next ten thousand years, and exhaust it. How
sweet to think of! my extremities well charred, and
my intellectual part too, so that there is no danger of
worm or rot for a long while. My breath is sweet to
me. O how I laugh when I think of my vague, indefinite
riches. No run on my bank can drain it, for my
wealth is not possession but enjoyment.</p>

<p>What are all these years made for? and now another
winter comes, so much like the last? Can't we satisfy
the beggars once for all?</p>

<p>Have you got in your wood for this winter? What
else have you got in? Of what use a great fire on the
hearth, and a confounded little fire in the heart? Are
you prepared to make a decisive campaign,&mdash;to pay
for your costly tuition,&mdash;to pay for the suns of past
summers,&mdash;for happiness and unhappiness lavished
upon you?</p>

<p>Does not Time go by swifter than the swiftest
equine trotter or racker?</p>

<p>Stir up Brown. Remind him of his duties, which
outrun the date and span of Worcester's years past
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
and to come. Tell him to be sure that he is on the
main street, however narrow it may be, and to have a
lit sign, visible by night as well as by day.</p>

<p>Are they not patient waiters,&mdash;they who wait for
us? But even they shall not be losers.</p>

<p class="address p2">
December 7.</p>

<p>That Walt Whitman, of whom I wrote to you, is the
most interesting fact to me at present. I have just read
his second edition (which he gave me), and it has done
me more good than any reading for a long time. Perhaps
I remember best the poem of Walt Whitman, an
American, and the Sun-Down Poem. There are two
or three pieces in the book which are disagreeable, to
say the least; simply sensual. He does not celebrate
love at all. It is as if the beasts spoke. I think that
men have not been ashamed of themselves without
reason. No doubt there have always been dens where
such deeds were unblushingly recited, and it is no merit
to compete with their inhabitants. But even on this
side he has spoken more truth than any American or
modern that I know. I have found his poem exhilarating,
encouraging. As for its sensuality,&mdash;and it may
turn out to be less sensual than it appears,&mdash;I do not
so much wish that those parts were not written, as that
men and women were so pure that they could read
them without harm, that is, without understanding
them. One woman told me that no woman could read
it,&mdash;as if a man could read what a woman could not.
Of course Walt Whitman can communicate to us no
experience, and if we are shocked, whose experience is
it that we are reminded of?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span></p>

<p>On the whole, it sounds to me very brave and American,
after whatever deductions. I do not believe that
all the sermons, so called, that have been preached in
this land put together are equal to it for preaching.</p>

<p>We ought to rejoice greatly in him. He occasionally
suggests something a little more than human. You
can't confound him with the other inhabitants of Brooklyn
or New York. How they must shudder when they
read him! He is awfully good.</p>

<p>To be sure I sometimes feel a little imposed on. By
his heartiness and broad generalities he puts me into a
liberal frame of mind prepared to see wonders,&mdash;as it
were, sets me upon a hill or in the midst of a plain,&mdash;stirs
me well up, and then&mdash;throws in a thousand of
brick. Though rude, and sometimes ineffectual, it is a
great primitive poem,&mdash;an alarum or trumpet-note
ringing through the American camp. Wonderfully like
the Orientals, too, considering that when I asked him
if he had read them, he answered, "No: tell me about
them."</p>

<p>I did not get far in conversation with him,&mdash;two
more being present,&mdash;and among the few things which
I chanced to say, I remember that one was, in answer
to him as representing America, that I did not think
much of America or of politics, and so on, which may
have been somewhat of a damper to him.</p>

<p>Since I have seen him, I find that I am not disturbed
by any brag or egoism in his book. He may turn out
the least of a braggart of all, having a better right to
be confident.</p>

<p>He is a great fellow.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">There is in Alcott's diary an account of this interview
with Whitman, and the Sunday morning in Ward
Beecher's Brooklyn church, from which a few passages
may be taken. Hardly any person met by either of
these Concord friends in their later years made so deep
an impression on both as did this then almost unknown
poet and thinker, concerning whom Cholmondeley
wrote to Thoreau in 1857: "Is there actually such a
man as Whitman? Has any one seen or handled him?
His is a tongue 'not understanded' of the English
people. I find <i>the gentleman</i> altogether left out of the
book. It is the first book I have ever seen which I
should call a 'new book.'"</p>

<p>Mr. Alcott writes under date of November 7, 1856,
in New York: "Henry Thoreau arrives from Eagleswood,
and sees Swinton, a wise young Scotchman, and
Walt Whitman's friend, at my room (15 Laight Street),&mdash;Thoreau
declining to accompany me to Mrs. Botta's
parlors, as invited by her. He sleeps here. (November
8.) We find Greeley at the Harlem station, and ride
with him to his farm, where we pass the day, and return
to sleep in the city,&mdash;Greeley coming in with us; Alice
Cary, the authoress, accompanying us also. (Sunday,
November 9.) We cross the ferry to Brooklyn, and
hear Ward Beecher at the Plymouth Church. It was a
spectacle,&mdash;and himself the preacher, if preacher there
be anywhere now in pulpits. His auditors had to weep,
had to laugh, under his potent magnetism, while his
doctrine of justice to all men, bond and free, was grand.
House, entries, aisles, galleries, all were crowded. Thoreau
called it pagan, but I pronounced it good, very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
good,&mdash;the best I had witnessed for many a day, and
hopeful for the coming time. At dinner at Mrs. Manning's.
Miss M. S. was there, curious to see Thoreau.
After dinner we called on Walt Whitman (Thoreau and
I), but finding him out, we got all we could from his
mother, a stately, sensible matron, believing absolutely
in Walter, and telling us how good he was, and how
wise when a boy; and how his four brothers and two
sisters loved him, and still take counsel of the great
man he has grown to be. We engaged to call again early
in the morning, when she said Walt would be glad to
see us. (Monday, 10th.) Mrs. Tyndale of Philadelphia
goes with us to see Walt,&mdash;Walt the satyr, the Bacchus,
the very god Pan. We sat with him for two hours, and
much to our delight; he promising to call on us at the
International at ten in the morning to-morrow, and
there have the rest of it." Whitman failed to call at
his hour the next day.</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, December 12, 1856.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wiley</span>,<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
&mdash;It is refreshing to hear of your earnest
purpose with respect to your culture, and I can send
you no better wish than that you may not be thwarted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
by the cares and temptations of life. Depend on it, <i>now</i>
is the accepted time, and probably you will never find
yourself better disposed or freer to attend to your culture
than at this moment. When <i>They</i> who inspire us
with the idea are ready, shall not we be ready also?</p>

<p>I do not remember anything which Confucius has
said directly respecting man's "origin, purpose, and
destiny." He was more practical than that. He is full
of wisdom applied to human relations,&mdash;to the private
life,&mdash;the family,&mdash;government, etc. It is remarkable
that, according to his own account, the sum and substance
of his teaching is, as you know, to do as you
would be done by.</p>

<p>He also said (I translate from the French), "Conduct
yourself suitably towards the persons of your family,
then you will be able to instruct and to direct a
nation of men."</p>

<p>"To nourish one's self with a little rice, to drink
water, to have only his bended arm to support his head,
is a state which has also its satisfaction. To be rich
and honored by iniquitous means is for me as the floating
cloud which passes."</p>

<p>"As soon as a child is born he must respect its faculties:
the knowledge which will come to it by and by
does not resemble at all its present state. If it arrive
at the age of forty or fifty years without having learned
anything, it is no more worthy of any respect." This
last, I think, will speak to your condition.</p>

<p>But at this rate I might fill many letters.</p>

<p>Our acquaintance with the ancient Hindoos is not
at all personal. The full names that can be relied upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
are very shadowy. It is, however, tangible works that
we know. The best I think of are the Bhagvat Geeta
(an episode in an ancient heroic poem called the Mahabarat),
the Vedas, the Vishnu Purana, the Institutes of
Menu, etc.</p>

<p>I cannot say that Swedenborg has been directly and
practically valuable to me, for I have not been a reader
of him, except to a slight extent; but I have the highest
regard for him, and trust that I shall read his works
in some world or other. He had a wonderful knowledge
of our interior and spiritual life, though his illuminations
are occasionally blurred by trivialities. He
comes nearer to answering, or attempting to answer,
literally, your questions concerning man's origin, purpose,
and destiny, than any of the worthies I have
referred to. But I think that that is not <i>altogether</i> a
recommendation; since such an answer to these questions
cannot be discovered any more than perpetual
motion, for which no reward is now offered. The noblest
man it is, methinks, that knows, and by his life
suggests, the most about these things. Crack away at
these nuts, however, as long as you can,&mdash;the very
exercise will ennoble you, and you may get something
better than the answer you expect.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO B. B. WILEY (AT CHICAGO).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, April 26, 1857.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wiley</span>,&mdash;I see that you are turning a broad
furrow among the books, but I trust that some very
private journal all the while holds its own through
their midst. Books can only reveal us to ourselves, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
as often as they do us this service we lay them aside.
I should say, read Goethe's autobiography, by all
means, also Gibbon's, Haydon the painter's, and our
Franklin's of course; perhaps also Alfieri's, Benvenuto
Cellini's, and De Quincey's "Confessions of an Opium-Eater,"&mdash;since
you like autobiography. I think you
must read Coleridge again, and further, skipping all
his theology, <i>i. e.</i>, if you value precise definitions and a
discriminating use of language. By the way, read De
Quincey's Reminiscences of Coleridge and Wordsworth.</p>

<p>How shall we account for our pursuits, if they are
original? We get the language with which to describe
our various lives out of a common mint. If others have
their losses which they are busy repairing, so have I
mine, and their hound and horse may <i>perhaps</i> be the
symbols of some of them.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
 But also I have lost, or am
in danger of losing, a far finer and more ethereal treasure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
which commonly no loss, of which they are conscious,
will symbolize. This I answer hastily and with
some hesitation, according as I now understand my
words....</p>

<p>Methinks a certain polygamy with its troubles is the
fate of almost all men. They are married to two wives:
their genius (a celestial muse), and also to some fair
daughter of the earth. Unless these two were fast
friends before marriage, and so are afterward, there
will be but little peace in the house.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, December 31, 1856.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Blake</span>,&mdash;I think it will not be worth the while
for me to come to Worcester to lecture at all this year.
It will be better to wait till I am&mdash;perhaps unfortunately&mdash;more
in that line. My writing has not taken
the shape of lectures, and therefore I should be obliged
to read one of three or four old lectures, the best of
which I have read to some of your auditors before. I
carried that one which I call "Walking, or the Wild,"
to Amherst, N. H., the evening of that cold Thursday,<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>

and I am to read another at Fitchburg, February 3.
I am simply their hired man. This will probably be
the extent of my lecturing hereabouts.</p>

<p>I must depend on meeting Mr. Wasson some other
time.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps it always costs me more than it comes to
to lecture before a promiscuous audience. It is an
irreparable injury done to my modesty even,&mdash;I become
so indurated.</p>

<p>O solitude! obscurity! meanness! I never triumph
so as when I have the least success in my neighbor's
eyes. The lecturer gets fifty dollars a night; but what
becomes of his winter? What consolation will it be
hereafter to have fifty thousand dollars for living in
the world? I should like not to exchange <i>any</i> of my
life for money.</p>

<p>These, you may think, are reasons for not lecturing,
when you have no great opportunity. It is even so,
perhaps. I could lecture on dry oak leaves; I could,
but who could hear me? If I were to try it on any
large audience, I fear it would be no gain to them, and
a positive loss to me. I should have behaved rudely
toward my rustling friends.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
</p>

<p>I am surveying, instead of lecturing, at present. Let
me have a skimming from your "pan of unwrinkled
cream."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">The proposition about Mr. Alcott in Thoreau's letter
of September 23, 1856, to Mr. Ricketson took effect in
the spring of 1857, and early in April he went to visit
the Ricketsons in New Bedford, going down from Walpole,
and there met his younger friends Channing and
Thoreau. Anticipating Mr. Alcott's visit, Thoreau
wrote thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center p2">TO DANIEL RICKETSON (AT NEW BEDFORD).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, March 28, 1857.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Friend Ricketson</span>,&mdash;If it chances to be perfectly
agreeable and convenient to you, I will make you a
visit next week (say Wednesday or Thursday), and we
will have some more rides to Assawampset and the
seashore. Have you got a boat on the former yet?
Who knows but we may camp out on the island? I
propose this now, because it will be more novel to me
at this season, and I should like to see your early birds,
etc.</p>

<p>Your historical papers have all come safely to hand,
and I thank you for them. I see that they will be indispensable
<i>mémoires pour servir</i>. By the way, have you
read Church's "History of Philip's War," and looked
up the localities? It should make part of a chapter.</p>

<p>I had a long letter from Cholmondeley lately, which
I should like to show you,</p>

<p>I will expect an answer to this straightway,&mdash;but be
sure you let your own convenience and inclinations rule
it. Please remember me to your family.</p>

<p class="p2">He was welcomed, of course, and went down April 2,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
as indicated in the letter of the day before. But he had
not been informed that Alcott was already there, writing
in his Diary of April 1, this sketch of Brooklawn and
its occupants:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A neat country residence, surrounded by wild pastures
and low woods,&mdash;the little stream Acushnet flowing
east of the house, and into Fairhaven Bay. The
hamlet of Acushnet at the 'Head of the River' lies
within half a mile of Ricketson's house. His tastes are
pastoral, simple even to wildness; and he passes a good
part of his day in the fields and woods,&mdash;or in his
rude 'Shanty' near his house, where he writes and reads
his favorite authors, Cowper having the first place. He
is in easy circumstances, and has the manners of an
English gentleman,&mdash;frank, hospitable, and with positive
persuasions of his own; mercurial, perhaps, and
wayward a little sometimes, but full of kindness and
sensibility to suffering."</p>

<p class="center p2">TO DANIEL RICKETSON (AT NEW BEDFORD).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, April 1, 1857.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Ricketson</span>,&mdash;I got your note of welcome
night before last. Channing is not here; at least I have
not seen nor heard of him, but depend on meeting him
in New Bedford. I expect, if the weather is favorable,
to take the 4.30 train from Boston to-morrow, Thursday,
<span class="smcap">P. M.</span>, for I hear of no noon train, and shall be
glad to find your wagon at Tarkiln Hill, for I see it
will be rather late for going across lots.</p>

<p>Alcott was here last week, and will probably visit
New Bedford within a week or two.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span></p>

<p>I have seen all the spring signs you mention, and a
few more, even here. Nay, I heard one frog peep
nearly a week ago,&mdash;methinks the very first one in all
this region. I wish that there were a few more signs of
spring in myself; however, I take it that there <i>are</i> as
many within us as we think we hear <i>without</i> us. I am
decent for a steady pace, but not yet for a race. I have
a little cold at present, and you speak of rheumatism
about the head and shoulders. Your frost is not quite
out. I suppose that the earth itself has a little cold and
rheumatism about these times; but all these things
together produce a very fair general result. In a concert,
you know, we must sing our parts feebly sometimes,
that we may not injure the general effect. I
should n't wonder if my two-year-old invalidity had
been a positively charming feature to some amateurs
favorably located. Why not a blasted man as well as
a blasted tree, on your lawn?</p>

<p>If you should happen not to see me by the train
named, do not go again, but wait at home for me, or
a note from</p>

<p class="left45">
Yours,<br />
<span class="smcap i2">Henry D. Thoreau</span>.</p>

<p>On that Thursday, April 2, Alcott wrote in his
Diary, "Henry Thoreau comes to tea, also Ellery
Channing, and we talk till into the evening late."
This visit of Thoreau was his longest, lasting until
April 15, and it was during the fortnight that he sang
"Tom Bowling" and danced with vigor in the Brooklawn
drawing-room, a scene which Alcott loved to describe.
Sophia Thoreau, writing in 1862, said: "I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
so often witnessed the like that I can easily imagine
how it was, and I remember that Henry gave me some
account. I recollect he said that he did not scruple to
tread on Mr. Alcott's toes."</p>

<p class="center p2">TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, April 17, 1857.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Blake</span>,&mdash;I returned from New Bedford night
before last. I met Alcott there, and learned from him
that probably you had gone to Concord. I am very
sorry that I missed you. I had expected you earlier,
and at last thought that I should get back before you
came; but I ought to have notified you of my absence.
However, it would have been too late, after I had made
up my mind to go. I hope you lost nothing by going
a little round.</p>

<p>I took out the celtis seeds at your request, at the
time we spoke of them, and left them in the chamber
on some shelf or other. If you have found them, very
well; if you have not found them, very well; but tell
Hale<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
 of it, if you see him. My mother says that you
and Brown and Rogers and Wasson (titles left behind)
talk of coming down on me some day. Do not fail to
come, one and all, and within a week or two, if possible;
else I may be gone again. Give me a short
notice, and then come and spend a day on Concord
River,&mdash;or say that you will come if it is fair, unless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
you are confident of bringing fair weather with you.
Come and be Concord, as I have been Worcestered.</p>

<p>Perhaps you came nearer to me for not finding me
at home; for trains of thought the more connect when
trains of cars do not. If I had actually met you, you
would have gone again; but now I have not yet dismissed
you. I hear what you say about personal relations
with joy. It is as if you had said: "I value the
best and finest part of you, and not the worst. I can
even endure your very near and real approach, and
prefer it to a shake of the hand." This intercourse is
not subject to time or distance.</p>

<p>I have a very long new and faithful letter from
Cholmondeley which I wish to show you. He speaks
of sending me more books!!</p>

<p>If I were with you now, I could tell you much of
Ricketson, and my visit to New Bedford; but I do
not know how it will be by and by. I should like to
have you meet R., who is the frankest man I know.
Alcott and he get along very well together. Channing
has returned to Concord with me,&mdash;probably for a
short visit only.</p>

<p>Consider this a business letter, which you know
<i>counts</i> nothing in the game we play. Remember me
particularly to Brown.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Blake</span>,&mdash;I have just got your note, but I am
sorry to say that I this very morning sent a note to
Channing, stating that I would go with him to Cape
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
Cod next week on an excursion which we have been
talking of for some time. If there were time to communicate
with you, I should ask you to come to Concord
on Monday, before I go; but as it is, I must wait
till I come back, which I think will be about ten days
hence. I do not like this delay, but there seems to be
a fate in it. Perhaps Mr. Wasson will be well enough to
come by that time. I will notify you of my return, and
shall depend on seeing you all.</p>

<p>June 23d. I returned from Cape Cod last evening,
and now take the first opportunity to invite you men
of Worcester to this quiet <i>Mediterranean</i> shore. Can
you come this week on Friday, or next Monday? I
mention the earliest days on which I suppose you can
be ready. If more convenient, name some other time
<i>within ten days</i>. I shall be rejoiced to see you, and to
act the part of skipper in the contemplated voyage. I
have just got another letter from Cholmondeley, which
may interest you somewhat.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO MARSTON WATSON (AT PLYMOUTH).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, August 17, 1857.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Watson</span>,&mdash;I am much indebted to you for
your glowing communication of July 20th. I had that
very day left Concord for the wilds of Maine; but when
I returned, August 8th, two out of the six worms remained
nearly, if not quite, as bright as at first, I was
assured. In their best estate they had excited the
admiration of many of the inhabitants of Concord. It
was a singular coincidence that I should find these
worms awaiting me, for my mind was full of a phosphorescence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
which I had seen in the woods. I have
waited to learn something more about them before
acknowledging the receipt of them. I have frequently
met with glow-worms in my night walks, but am not
sure they were the same kind with these. Dr. Harris
once described to me a larger kind than I had found,
"nearly as big as your little finger;" but he does not
name them in his report.</p>

<p>The only authorities on Glow-worms which I chance
to have (and I am pretty well provided) are Kirby and
Spence (the fullest), Knapp ("Journal of a Naturalist"),
"The Library of Entertaining Knowledge" (Rennie), a
French work, etc., etc.; but there is no minute, scientific
description of any of these. This is apparently a
female of the genus <i>Lampyris</i>; but Kirby and Spence
say that there are nearly two hundred species of this
genus alone. The one commonly referred to by English
writers is the <i>Lampyris noctiluca</i>; but judging from
Kirby and Spence's description, and from the description
and plate in the French work, this is not that one,
for, besides other differences, both say that the light
proceeds from the abdomen. Perhaps the worms exhibited
by Durkee (whose statement to the Boston
Society of Natural History, second July meeting, in the
<i>Traveller</i> of August 12, 1857, I send you) were the same
with these. I do not see how they could be the <i>L.
noctiluca</i>, as he states.</p>

<p>I expect to go to Cambridge before long, and if I get
any more light on this subject I will inform you. The
two worms are still alive.</p>

<p>I shall be glad to receive the drosera at any time, if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
you chance to come across it. I am looking over
Loudon's "Arboretum," which we have added to our
library, and it occurs to me that it was written expressly
for you, and that you cannot avoid placing it
on your own shelves.</p>

<p>I should have been glad to see the whale, and might
perhaps have done so, if I had not at that time been
seeing "the elephant" (or moose) in the Maine woods.
I have been associating for about a month with one
Joseph Polis, the chief man of the Penobscot tribe of
Indians, and have learned a great deal from him, which
I should like to tell you some time.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO DANIEL RICKETSON (AT NEW BEDFORD).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, August 18, 1857.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Your Wilson Flagg<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
 seems a serious
person, and it is encouraging to hear of a contemporary
who recognizes Nature so squarely, and selects such a
theme as "Barns." (I would rather "Mount Auburn"
were omitted.) But he is not alert enough. He wants
stirring up with a pole. He should practice turning a
series of somersets rapidly or jump up and see how
many times he can strike his feet together before coming
down. Let him make the earth turn round now the
other way, and whet his wits on it, whichever way it
goes, as on a grindstone; in short, see how many ideas
he can entertain at once.</p>

<p>His style, as I remember, is singularly vague (I refer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
to the book), and, before I got to the end of the sentences,
I was off the track. If you indulge in long periods,
you must be sure to have a snapper at the end. As for
style of writing, if one has anything to say, it drops
from him simply and directly, as a stone falls to the
ground. There are no two ways about it, but down it
comes, and he may stick in the points and stops wherever
he can get a chance. New ideas come into this
world somewhat like falling meteors, with a flash and
an explosion, and perhaps somebody's castle-roof perforated.
To try to polish the stone in its descent, to
give it a peculiar turn, and make it whistle a tune, perchance,
would be of no use, if it were possible. Your
polished stuff turns out not to be meteoric, but of this
earth. However, there is plenty of time, and Nature is
an admirable schoolmistress.</p>

<p>Speaking of correspondence, you ask me if I "cannot
turn over a new leaf in that line." I certainly could
if I were to receive it; but just then I looked up and
saw that your page was dated "May 10," though mailed
in August, and it occurred to me that I had seen you
since that date this year. Looking again, it appeared
that your note was written in '56!! However, it was a
<i>new</i> leaf to me, and I <i>turned it over</i> with as much
interest as if it had been written the day before. Perhaps
you kept it so long in order that the manuscript
and subject-matter might be more in keeping with the
old-fashioned paper on which it was written.</p>

<p>I traveled the length of Cape Cod on foot, soon after
you were here, and, within a few days, have returned
from the wilds of Maine, where I have made a journey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
of three hundred and twenty-five miles with a canoe
and an Indian, and a single white companion,&mdash;Edward
Hoar, Esq., of this town, lately from California,&mdash;traversing
the head waters of the Kennebec, Penobscot,
and St. John.</p>

<p>Can't you extract any advantage out of that depression
of spirits you refer to? It suggests to me cider-mills,
wine-presses, etc., etc. All kinds of pressure or
power should be used and made to turn some kind of
machinery.</p>

<p>Channing was just leaving Concord for Plymouth
when I arrived, but said he should be here again in
two or three days.</p>

<p>Please remember me to your family, and say that I
have at length learned to sing "Tom Bowlin" according
to the notes.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO DANIEL RICKETSON (AT NEW BEDFORD).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, September 9, 1857.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Friend Ricketson</span>,&mdash;I thank you for your kind
invitation to visit you, but I have taken so many vacations
this year,&mdash;at New Bedford, Cape Cod, and
Maine,&mdash;that any more relaxation&mdash;call it rather dissipation&mdash;will
cover me with shame and disgrace. I
have not earned what I have already enjoyed. As some
heads cannot carry much wine, so it would seem that
I cannot bear so much society as you can. I have an
immense appetite for solitude, like an infant for sleep,
and if I don't get enough of it this year, I shall cry all
the next.</p>

<p>My mother's house is full at present; but if it were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
not, I would have no right to invite you hither, while
entertaining such designs as I have hinted at. However,
if you care to storm the town, I will engage to
take some afternoon walks with you,&mdash;retiring into
profoundest solitude the most sacred part of the day.</p>

<p class="p2">Ricketson had written to invite Thoreau to visit him
again, saying among other things, "Walton's small
sailboat is now on Assawampset Pond." After visiting
Concord that autumn, he proposed another visit in December,
saying (December 11, 1857), "I long to see
your long beard. Channing says it is terrible to behold,
but improves you mightily." This fixes the date, late
in that year, when Thoreau first wore his full beard, as
shown in his latest portraits.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, August 18, 1857.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Blake</span>,&mdash;Fifteenthly. It seems to me that you
need some absorbing pursuit. It does not matter much
what it is, so it be honest. Such employment will be
favorable to your development in more characteristic
and important directions. You know there must be
impulse enough for steerageway, though it be not
toward your port, to prevent your drifting helplessly on
to rocks or shoals. Some sails are set for this purpose
only. There is the large fleet of scholars and men of
science, for instance, always to be seen standing off
and on every coast, and saved thus from running on
to reefs, who will at last run into their proper haven,
we trust.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span></p>

<p>It is a pity you were not here with Brown and Wiley.
I think that in this case, <i>for a rarity</i>, the more the
merrier.</p>

<p>You perceived that I did not entertain the idea of
our going together to Maine on such an excursion as I
had planned. The more I thought of it, the more imprudent
it appeared to me. I did think to have written
you before going, though not to propose your going
also; but I went at last very suddenly, and could only
have written a business letter, if I had tried, when
there was no business to be accomplished. I have now
returned, and think I have had a quite profitable journey,
chiefly from associating with an intelligent Indian.
My companion, Edward Hoar, also found his account
in it, though he suffered considerably from being obliged
to carry unusual loads over wet and rough "carries,"&mdash;in
one instance five miles through a swamp, where the
water was frequently up to our knees, and the fallen
timber higher than our heads. He went over the ground
three times, not being able to carry all his load at once.
This prevented his ascending Ktaadn. Our best nights
were those when it rained the hardest, on account of
the mosquitoes. I speak of these things, which were
not unexpected, merely to account for my not inviting
you.</p>

<p>Having returned, I flatter myself that the world appears
in some respects a little larger, and not, as usual,
smaller and shallower, for having extended my range.
I have made a short excursion into the new world
which the Indian dwells in, or is. He begins where we
leave off. It is worth the while to detect new faculties
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
in man,&mdash;he is so much the more divine; and anything
that fairly excites our admiration expands us. The
Indian, who can find his way so wonderfully in the
woods, possesses so much intelligence which the white
man does not,&mdash;and it increases my own capacity, as
well as faith, to observe it. I rejoice to find that intelligence
flows in other channels than I knew. It redeems
for me portions of what seemed brutish before.</p>

<p>It is a great satisfaction to find that your oldest convictions
are permanent. With regard to essentials, I
have never had occasion to change my mind. The aspect
of the world varies from year to year, as the landscape
is differently clothed, but I find that the <i>truth</i> is
still <i>true</i>, and I never regret any emphasis which it may
have inspired. Ktaadn is there still, but much more
surely my old conviction is there, resting with more
than mountain breadth and weight on the world, the
source still of fertilizing streams, and affording glorious
views from its summit, if I can get up to it again. As
the mountains still stand on the plain, and far more
unchangeable and permanent,&mdash;stand still grouped
around, farther or nearer to my maturer eye, the ideas
which I have entertained,&mdash;the everlasting teats from
which we draw our nourishment.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, November 16, 1857.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Blake</span>,&mdash;You have got the start again. It was
I that owed you a letter or two, if I mistake not.</p>

<p>They make a great ado nowadays about hard times;<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
but I think that the community generally, ministers
and all, take a wrong view of the matter, though some
of the ministers preaching according to a formula may
pretend to take a right one. This general failure, both
private and public, is rather occasion for rejoicing, as
reminding us whom we have at the helm,&mdash;that justice
is always done. If our merchants did not most of
them fail, and the banks too, my faith in the old laws
of the world would be staggered. The statement that
ninety-six in a hundred doing such business surely
break down is perhaps the sweetest fact that statistics
have revealed,&mdash;exhilarating as the fragrance of sallows
in spring. Does it not say somewhere, "The Lord
reigneth, let the earth rejoice"? If thousands are
thrown out of employment, it suggests that they were
not well employed. Why don't they take the hint? It
is not enough to be industrious; so are the ants. What
are you industrious about?</p>

<p>The merchants and company have long laughed at
transcendentalism, higher laws, etc., crying, "None of
your moonshine," as if they were anchored to something
not only definite, but sure and permanent. If
there was any institution which was presumed to rest
on a solid and secure basis, and more than any other
represented this boasted common sense, prudence, and
practical talent, it was the bank; and now those very
banks are found to be mere reeds shaken by the wind.
Scarcely one in the land has kept its promise.... It
would seem as if you only need live forty years in any
age of this world, to see its most promising government
become the government of Kansas, and banks nowhere.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
Not merely the Brook Farm and Fourierite communities,
but now the community generally has failed. But
there is the moonshine still, serene, beneficent, and unchanged.
Hard times, I say, have this value, among
others, that they show us what such promises are
worth,&mdash;where the <i>sure</i> banks are. I heard some Mr.
Eliot praised the other day because he had paid some
of his debts, though it took nearly all he had (why, I've
done as much as that myself many times, and a little
more), and then gone to board. What if he has? I
hope he's got a good boarding-place, and can pay for
it. It's not everybody that can. However, in my
opinion, it is cheaper to keep house,&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, if you
don't keep too big a one.</p>

<p>Men will tell you sometimes that "money's hard."
That shows it was not made to eat, I say. Only think
of a man in this new world, in his log cabin, in the
midst of a corn and potato patch, with a sheepfold on
one side, talking about money being hard! So are
flints hard; there is no alloy in them. What has that
got to do with his raising his food, cutting his wood (or
breaking it), keeping indoors when it rains, and, if
need be, spinning and weaving his clothes? Some of
those who sank with the steamer the other day found
out that money was <i>heavy</i> too. Think of a man's priding
himself on this kind of wealth, as if it greatly enriched
him. As if one struggling in mid-ocean with a
bag of gold on his back should gasp out, "I am worth
a hundred thousand dollars." I see them struggling
just as ineffectually on dry land, nay, even more hopelessly,
for, in the former case, rather than sink, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
will finally let the bag go; but in the latter they are
pretty sure to hold and go down with it. I see them
swimming about in their greatcoats, collecting their
rents, really <i>getting their dues</i>, drinking bitter draughts
which only increase their thirst, becoming more and
more water-logged, till finally they sink plumb down
to the bottom. But enough of this.</p>

<p>Have you ever read Ruskin's books? If not, I would
recommend [you] to try the second and third volumes
(not parts) of his "Modern Painters." I am now
reading the fourth, and have read most of his other books
lately. They are singularly good and encouraging,
though not without crudeness and bigotry. The themes
in the volumes referred to are Infinity, Beauty, Imagination,
Love of Nature, etc.,&mdash;all treated in a very living
manner. I am rather surprised by them. It is remarkable
that these things should be said with reference to
painting chiefly, rather than literature. The "Seven
Lamps of Architecture," too, is made of good stuff;
but, as I remember, there is too much about art in it
for me and the Hottentots. We want to know about
matters and things in general. Our house is as yet a
hut.</p>

<p>You must have been enriched by your solitary walk
over the mountains. I suppose that I feel the same awe
when on their summits that many do on entering a
church. To see what kind of earth that is on which
you have a house and garden somewhere, perchance!
It is equal to the lapse of many years. You must ascend
a mountain to learn your relation to matter, and
so to your own body, for <i>it</i> is at home there, though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
<i>you</i> are not. It might have been composed there, and
will have no farther to go to return to dust there, than
in your garden; but your spirit inevitably comes away,
and brings your body with it, if it lives. Just as awful
really, and as glorious, is your garden. See how I can
play with my fingers! They are the funniest companions
I have ever found. Where did they come from?
What strange control I have over them! <i>Who</i> am I?
What are they?&mdash;those little peaks&mdash;call them Madison,
Jefferson, Lafayette. What is <i>the matter</i>? <i>My</i>
fingers, do I say? Why, ere long, they may form the
topmost crystal of Mount Washington. I go up there
to see my body's cousins. There are some fingers, toes,
bowels, etc., that I take an interest in, and therefore
I am interested in all their relations.</p>

<p>Let me suggest a theme for you: to state to yourself
precisely and completely what that walk over the
mountains amounted to for you,&mdash;returning to this
essay again and again, until you are satisfied that all
that was important in your experience is in it. Give
this good reason to yourself for having gone over the
mountains, for mankind is ever going over a mountain.
Don't suppose that you can tell it precisely the first
dozen times you try, but at 'em again, especially where,
after a sufficient pause, you suspect that you are touching
the heart or summit of the matter, reiterate your
blows there, and account for the mountain to yourself.
Not that the story need be long, but it will take a long
while to make it short. It did not take very long to
get over the mountain, you thought; but have you got
over it indeed? If you have been to the top of Mount
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
Washington, let me ask, what did you find there?
That is the way they prove witnesses, you know. Going
up there and being blown on is nothing. We never
do much climbing while we are there, but we eat our
luncheon, etc., very much as at home. It is after we
get home that we really go over the mountain, if ever.
What did the mountain say? What did the mountain
do?</p>

<p>I keep a mountain anchored off eastward a little
way, which I ascend in my dreams both awake and
asleep. Its broad base spreads over a village or two,
which does not know it; neither does it know them, nor
do I when I ascend it. I can see its general outline as
plainly now in my mind as that of Wachusett. I do
not invent in the least, but state exactly what I see. I
find that I go up it when I am light-footed and earnest.
It ever smokes like an altar with its sacrifice. I am not
aware that a single villager frequents it or knows of it.
I keep this mountain to ride instead of a horse.</p>

<p>Do you not mistake about seeing Moosehead Lake
from Mount Washington? That must be about one
hundred and twenty miles distant, or nearly twice as
far as the Atlantic, which last some doubt if they can
see thence. Was it not Umbagog?</p>

<p>Dr. Solger<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
 has been lecturing in the vestry in this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
town on Geography, to Sanborn's scholars, for several
months past, at five <span class="smcap">P. M.</span> Emerson and Alcott have
been to hear him. I was surprised when the former
asked me, the other day, if I was not going to hear Dr.
Solger. What, to be sitting in a meeting-house cellar
at that time of day, when you might possibly be outdoors!
I never thought of such a thing. What was the
sun made for? If he does not prize daylight, I do.
Let him lecture to owls and dormice. He must be a
wonderful lecturer indeed who can keep me indoors at
such an hour, when the night is coming in which no
man can walk.</p>

<p>Are you in want of amusement nowadays? Then
play a little at the game of getting a living. There
never was anything equal to it. Do it temperately,
though, and don't sweat. Don't let this secret out, for
I have a design against the Opera. <span class="smcap">Opera!!</span> Pass
along the exclamations, devil.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
</p>

<p>Now is the time to become conversant with your
wood-pile (this comes under Work for the Month), and
be sure you put some warmth into it by your mode of
getting it. Do not consent to be passively warmed. An
intense degree of that is the hotness that is threatened.
But a positive warmth within can withstand the fiery
furnace, as the vital heat of a living man can withstand
the heat that cooks meat.</p>

<p class="p2">After returning from the last of his three expeditions
to the Maine woods (in 1846, 1853, and 1857), Thoreau
was appealed to by his friend Higginson, then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
living in Worcester, for information concerning a proposed
excursion from Worcester into Maine and Canada,
then but little visited by tourists, who now go
there in droves. He replied in this long letter, with its
minute instructions and historical references. The Arnold
mentioned is General Benedict Arnold, who in
1775-76 made a toilsome march through the Maine
forest with a small New England army for the conquest
of Canada, while young John Thoreau, Henry's
grandfather, was establishing himself as a merchant in
Boston (not yet evacuated by British troops), previous
to his marriage with Jane Burns.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO T. W. HIGGINSON (AT WORCESTER).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, January 28, 1858.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;It would be perfectly practicable to go
to the Madawaska the way you propose. As for the route
to Quebec, I do not find the Sugar Loaf Mountains on
my maps. The most direct and regular way, as you
know, is substantially Montresor's and Arnold's and
the younger John Smith's&mdash;by the Chaudière; but
this is less wild. If your object is to see the St. Lawrence
River below Quebec, you will probably strike it
at the Rivière du Loup. (<i>Vide</i> Hodge's account of his
excursion thither <i>via</i> the Allegash,&mdash;I believe it is the
second Report on the Geology of the Public Lands of
Maine and Massachusetts in '37.) I think that our
Indian last summer, when we talked of going to the
St. Lawrence, named another route, near the Madawaska,&mdash;perhaps
the St. Francis,&mdash;which would save
the long portage which Hodge made.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span></p>

<p>I do not know whether you think of ascending the
St. Lawrence in a canoe; but if you should, you might
be delayed not only by the current, but by the waves,
which frequently run too high for a canoe on such a
mighty stream. It would be a grand excursion to go
to Quebec by the Chaudière, descend the St. Lawrence
to the Rivière du Loup, and return by the Madawaska
and St. John to Fredericton, or farther,&mdash;almost all
the way <i>down-stream</i>&mdash;a very important consideration.</p>

<p>I went to Moosehead in company with a party of
four who were going a-hunting down the Allegash and
St. John, and thence by some other stream over into
the Restigouche, and down that to the Bay of Chaleur,&mdash;to
be gone six weeks. Our northern terminus
was an island in Heron Lake on the Allegash. (<i>Vide</i>
Colton's railroad and township map of Maine.)</p>

<p>The Indian proposed that we should return to Bangor
by the St. John and Great Schoodic Lake, which we
had thought of ourselves; and he showed us on the map
where we should be each night. It was then noon,
and the next day night, continuing down the Allegash,
we should have been at the Madawaska settlements,
having made only one or two portages; and thereafter,
on the St. John there would be but one or two more
falls, with short carries; and if there was not too much
wind, we could go down that stream one hundred
miles a day. It is settled all the way below Madawaska.
He knew the route well. He even said that this was
easier, and would take but little more time, though
much farther, than the route we decided on,&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>,
by Webster Stream, the East Branch, and main Penobscot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
to Oldtown; but he may have wanted a longer
job. We preferred the latter, not only because it was
shorter, but because, as he said, it was wilder.</p>

<p>We went about three hundred and twenty-five miles
with the canoe (including sixty miles of stage between
Bangor and Oldtown); were out twelve nights, and
spent about $40 apiece,&mdash;which was more than was
necessary. We paid the Indian, who was a very good
one, $1.50 per day and 50 cents a week for his canoe.
This is enough in ordinary seasons. I had formerly
paid $2 for an Indian and for white batteau-men.</p>

<p>If you go to Madawaska in a leisurely manner, supposing
no delay on account of rain or the violence
of the wind, you may reach Mt. Kineo by noon, and
have the afternoon to explore it. The next day you
may get to the head of the lake before noon, make the
portage of two and a half miles over a wooden railroad,
and drop down the Penobscot half a dozen miles.
The third morning you will perhaps walk half a mile
about Pine Stream Falls, while the Indian runs down,&mdash;cross
the head of Chesuncook, reach the junction of
the Caucomgomock and Umbazookskus by noon, and
ascend the latter to Umbazookskus Lake that night.
If it is low water, you may have to walk and carry a
little on the Umbazookskus before entering the lake.
The fourth morning you will make the carry of two
miles to Mud Pond (Allegash water),&mdash;and a very
wet carry it is,&mdash;and reach Chamberlain Lake by
noon, and Heron Lake, perhaps, that night, after a
couple of very short carries at the outlet of Chamberlain.
At the end of two days more you will probably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
be at Madawaska. Of course the Indian <i>can</i> paddle
twice as far in a day as he commonly does.</p>

<p>Perhaps you would like a few more details. We
used (three of us) exactly twenty-six pounds of hard
bread, fourteen pounds of pork, three pounds of coffee,
twelve pounds of sugar (and could have used more),
besides a little tea, Indian meal, and rice,&mdash;and plenty
of berries and moose-meat. This was faring very
luxuriously. I had not formerly carried coffee, sugar,
or rice. But for solid food, I decide that it is not worth
the while to carry anything but hard bread and pork,
whatever your tastes and habits may be. These wear
best, and you have no time nor dishes in which to cook
anything else. Of course you will take a little Indian
meal to fry fish in; and half a dozen lemons also, if
you have sugar, will be very refreshing,&mdash;for the water
is warm.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
</p>

<p>To save time, the sugar, coffee, tea, salt, etc., should
be in separate water-tight bags, labeled, and tied with a
leathern string; and all the provisions and blankets
should be put into two large india-rubber bags, if you
can find them water-tight. Ours were not. A four-quart
tin pail makes a good kettle for all purposes, and tin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
plates are portable and convenient. Don't forget an
india-rubber knapsack, with a large flap,&mdash;plenty of
dish-cloths, old newspapers, strings, and twenty-five feet
of strong cord. Of india-rubber clothing, the most you
can wear, if any, is a very light coat,&mdash;and that you
cannot work in. I could be more particular,&mdash;but perhaps
have been too much so already.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO MARSTON WATSON (AT PLYMOUTH).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, April 25, 1858.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Your unexpected gift of pear trees
reached me yesterday in good condition, and I spent
the afternoon in giving them a good setting out; but I
fear that this cold weather may hurt them. However,
I am inclined to think they are insured, since you have
looked on them. It makes one's mouth water to read
their names only. From what I hear of the extent of
your bounty, if a reasonable part of the trees succeed,
this transplanting will make a new era for Concord to
date from.</p>

<p>Mine must be a lucky star, for day before yesterday
I received a box of mayflowers from Brattleboro, and
yesterday morning your pear trees, and at evening a
hummingbird's nest from Worcester. This looks like
fairy housekeeping.</p>

<p>I discovered two new plants in Concord last winter,
the Labrador tea (<i>Ledum latifolium</i>), and yew (<i>Taxis
baccata</i>).</p>

<p>By the way, in January I communicated with Dr.
Durkee, whose report on glow-worms I sent you, and
it appeared, as I expected, that he (and by his account
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
Agassiz, Gould, Jackson, and others to whom he showed
them) did not consider them a distinct species, but a
variety of the common, or <i>Lampyris noctiluca</i>, some of
which you got in Lincoln. Durkee, at least, has never
seen the last. I told him that I had no doubt about
their being a distinct species. His, however, were luminous
throughout every part of the body, as those which
you sent me were not, while I had them.</p>

<p>Is nature as full of vigor to your eyes as ever, or do
you detect some falling off at last? Is the mystery of
the hog's bristle cleared up, and with it that of our
life? It is the question, to the exclusion of every other
interest.</p>

<p>I am sorry to hear of the burning of your woods, but,
thank Heaven, your great ponds and your sea cannot
be burnt. I love to think of your warm, sandy wood-roads,
and your breezy island out in the sea. What a
prospect you can get every morning from the hilltop
east of your house!<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
 I think that even the heathen that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
I am could say, or sing, or dance, morning prayers
there of some kind.</p>

<p>Please remember me to Mrs. Watson, and to the rest
of your family who are helping the sun shine yonder.</p>

<p class="p2">Of his habits in mountain-climbing, Channing says:<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>

"He ascended such hills as Monadnoc by his own path;
would lay down his map on the summit and draw a
line to the point he proposed to visit below,&mdash;perhaps
forty miles away on the landscape, and set off bravely
to make the 'short-cut.' The lowland people wondered
to see him scaling the heights as if he had lost his way,
or at his jumping over their cow-yard fences,&mdash;asking
if he had fallen from the clouds. In a walk like this he
always carried his umbrella; and on this Monadnoc
trip, when about a mile from the station [in Troy, N. H.],
a torrent of rain came down; without the umbrella his
books, blankets, maps, and provisions would all have
been spoiled, or the morning lost by delay. On the
mountain there being a thick, soaking fog, the first object
was to camp and make tea. He spent five nights
in camp, having built another hut, to get varied views.
Flowers, birds, lichens, and the rocks were carefully
examined, all parts of the mountain were visited, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
as accurate a map as could be made by pocket compass
was carefully sketched and drawn out, in the five days
spent there,&mdash;with notes of the striking aerial phenomena,
incidents of travel and natural history. The
outlook across the valley over to Wachusett, with its
thunder-storms and battles in the cloud; the farmers'
back-yards in Jaffrey, where the family cotton can be
seen bleaching on the grass, but no trace of the pigmy
family; the dry, soft air all night, the lack of dew in
the morning; the want of water,&mdash;a pint being a good
deal,&mdash;these, and similar things make up some part of
such an excursion."</p>

<p>The Monadnock excursion above mentioned began
June 3d, and continued three days. It inspired Thoreau
to take a longer mountain tour with his neighbor and
friend Edward Hoar, to which these letters relate, giving
the ways and means of the journey,&mdash;a memorable
one to all concerned.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, June 29, 1858, 8 <span class="smcap">A. M.</span>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Blake</span>,&mdash;Edward Hoar and I propose to start
for the White Mountains in a covered wagon, with one
horse, on the morning of Thursday the 1st of July, intending
to explore the mountain-tops botanically, and
camp on them at least several times. Will you take a
seat in the wagon with us? Mr. Hoar prefers to hire
the horse and wagon himself. Let us hear by express,
as soon as you can, whether you will join us here by
the earliest train on Thursday morning, or Wednesday
night. Bring your map of the mountains, and as much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
<i>provision</i> for the road as you can,&mdash;hard bread, sugar,
tea, meat, etc.,&mdash;for we intend to live like gipsies; also,
a blanket and some thick clothes for the mountain-top.</p>

<p class="p2">July 1st. Last Monday evening Mr. Edward Hoar
said that he thought of going to the White Mountains.
I remarked casually that I should like to go well enough
if I could afford it. Whereupon he declared that if I
would go with him, he would hire a horse and wagon,
so that the ride would cost me nothing, and we would
explore the mountain-tops <i>botanically</i>, camping on them
many nights. The next morning I suggested you and
Brown's accompanying us in another wagon, and we
could all camp and cook, gipsy-like, along the way,&mdash;or,
perhaps, if the horse could draw us, you would like
to bear half the expense of the horse and wagon, and
take a seat with us. He liked either proposition, but
said that if you would take a seat with us, he would
prefer to hire the horse and wagon himself. You could
contribute something else if you pleased. Supposing
that Brown would be confined, I wrote to you accordingly,
by <i>express</i> on Tuesday morning, <i>via</i> Boston, stating
that we should start to-day, suggesting provision,
thick clothes, etc., and asking for an answer; but I have
not received one. I have just heard that you <i>may</i> be
at Sterling, and now write to say that we shall still be
glad if you will join us at Senter Harbor, where we
expect to be next Monday morning. In any case, will
you please direct a letter to us there <i>at once</i>?

<p class="center p2">TO DANIEL RICKETSON (AT NEW BEDFORD).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, June 30, 1858.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Friend Ricketson</span>,&mdash;I am on the point of starting
for the White Mountains in a wagon with my neighbor
Edward Hoar, and I write to you now rather to apologize
for not writing, than to answer worthily your three
notes. I thank you heartily for them. You will not
care for a little delay in acknowledging them, since
your date shows that you can afford to wait. Indeed,
my head has been so full of company, etc., that I could
not reply to you fitly before, nor can I now.</p>

<p>As for preaching to men these days in the Walden
strain, is it of any consequence to preach to an audience
of men who <i>can</i> fail, or who can be <i>revived</i>? There
are few beside. Is it any success to interest these parties?
If a man has <i>speculated</i> and <i>failed</i>, he will probably
do these things again, in spite of you or me. I
confess that it is rare that I rise to sentiment in my relations
to men,&mdash;ordinarily to a mere patient, or may
be wholesome, good-will. I can imagine something
more, but the truth compels me to regard the ideal and
the actual as two things.</p>

<p>Channing has come, and as suddenly gone, and left
a short poem, "Near Home," published (?) or printed
by Munroe, which I have hardly had time to glance
at. As you may guess, I learn nothing of you from
him.</p>

<p>You already foresee my answer to your invitation to
make you a summer visit: I am bound for the mountains.
But I trust that you have vanquished, ere this,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
those dusky demons that seem to lurk around the Head
of the River.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
 You know that this warfare is nothing
but a kind of nightmare, and it is our thoughts alone
which give those <i>un</i>worthies any body or existence.</p>

<p>I made an excursion with Blake, of Worcester, to
Monadnock, a few weeks since. We took our blankets
and food, spent two nights on the mountain, and did
not go into a house.</p>

<p>Alcott has been very busy for a long time repairing
an old shell of a house, and I have seen very little of
him.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
 I have looked more at the houses which birds
build. Watson made us all very generous presents from
his nursery in the spring. Especially did he remember
Alcott.</p>

<p>Excuse me for not writing any more at present, and
remember me to your family.</p>

<p class="p2">In explanation of the next letter (October 31, 1858),
it may be said that Ricketson had formed a plan for
visiting Europe, which he gave up, and had recommended
an "English Australian" who proposed to see
Concord. In Thoreau's reply, he mentions Mr. Hoar,
who was not only his companion in later journeys, but,
while in college or the Harvard Law School, had assisted
Thoreau in that accidental forest fire, mentioned
in the Journal, which brought both the young men into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
much disrepute among the Concord farmers and owners
of wood-lots. At the date of the letter, Channing
was flitting between New Bedford and Concord, and
soon returned to spend the rest of his days in Thoreau's
town, where he died, December 23, 1901, the last survivor
of the group of friends to whom these letters
relate.</p>

<p>In July, 1858, as mentioned in this letter to Mr.
Ricketson, Thoreau journeyed from Concord to the
White Mountains, first visited with his brother John in
1839. His later companion was Edward Hoar, a botanist
and lover of nature, who had been a magistrate in
California, and in boyhood a comrade of Thoreau in
shooting excursions on the Concord meadows. They
journeyed in a wagon and Thoreau disliked the loss
of independence in choice of camping-places involved
in the care of a horse. He complained also of the
magnificent inns ("mountain houses") that had sprung
up in the passes and on the plateaus since his first visit.
"Give me," he said, "a spruce house made in the
rain," such as he and Channing afterward (1860) made
on Monadnock in his last trip to that mountain. The
chief exploit in the White Mountain trip was a visit to
Tuckerman's Ravine on Mt. Washington, of which Mr.
Hoar, some years before his death (in 1893), gave me
an account, containing the true anecdote of Thoreau's
finding the arnica plant when he needed it.</p>

<p>On their way to this rather inaccessible chasm, Thoreau
and his comrade went first to what was then but
a small tavern on the "tip-top" of Mt. Washington.
It was a foggy day; and when the landlord was asked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
if he could furnish a guide to Tuckerman's Ravine, he
replied, "Yes, my brother is the guide; but if he went
to-day he could never find his way back in this fog."
"Well," said Thoreau, "if we cannot have a guide we
will find it ourselves;" and he at once produced a map
he had made the day before at a roadside inn, where
he had found a wall map of the mountain region, and
climbed on a table to copy that portion he needed.
With this map and his pocket compass he "struck a
bee-line," said Mr. Hoar, for the ravine, and soon
came to it, about a mile away. They went safely down
the steep stairs into the chasm, where they found the
midsummer iceberg they wished to see. But as they
walked down the bed of the Peabody River, flowing
from this ravine, over boulders five or six feet high, the
heavy packs on their shoulders weighed them down,
and finally, Thoreau's foot slipping, he fell and sprained
his ankle. He rose, but had not limped five steps from
the place where he fell, when he said, "Here is the
arnica, anyhow,"&mdash;reached out his hand and plucked
the <i>Arnica mollis</i>, which he had not before found anywhere.
Before reaching the mountains they had marked
in their botany books forty-six species of plants they
hoped to find there, and before they came away they
had found forty-two of them.</p>

<p>When they reached their camping-place, farther down,
Thoreau was so lame he could not move about, and
lay there in the camp several days, eating the pork and
other supplies they had in their packs, Mr. Hoar going
each day to the inn at the mountain summit. This
camp was in a thicket of dwarf firs at the foot of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
ravine, where, just before his accident, by carelessness
in lighting a fire, some acres of the mountain woodland
had been set on fire; but this proved to be the signal
for which Thoreau had told his Worcester friends to
watch, if they wished to join him on the mountain. "I
had told Blake," says Thoreau in his Journal, "to look
out for a smoke and a white tent. We had made a
smoke sure enough. We slept five in the tent that night,
and found it quite warm." Mr. Hoar added: "In this
journey Thoreau insisted on our carrying heavy packs,
and rather despised persons who complained of the
burden. He was chagrined, in the Maine woods, to
find his Indian, Joe Polis (whom, on the whole, he admired),
excited and tremulous at sight of a moose, so
that he could scarcely load his gun properly. Joe, who
was a good Catholic, wanted us to stop traveling on
Sunday and hold a meeting; and when we insisted on
going forward, the Indian withdrew into the woods to
say his prayers,&mdash;then came back and picked up the
breakfast things, and we paddled on. As to Thoreau's
courage and manliness, nobody who had seen him
among the Penobscot rocks and rapids&mdash;the Indian
trusting his life and his canoe to Henry's skill, promptitude,
and nerve&mdash;would ever doubt it."</p>

<p>Channing says:<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
 "In his later journeys, if his companion
was footsore or loitered, he steadily pursued his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
road. Once, when a follower was done up with headache
and incapable of motion, hoping his associate
would comfort him and perhaps afford him a sip of
tea, he said, 'There are people who are sick in that
way every morning, and go about their affairs,' and then
marched off about his. In such limits, so inevitable,
was he compacted.... This tone of mind grew out
of no insensibility; or, if he sometimes looked coldly
on the suffering of more tender natures, he sympathized
with their afflictions, but could do nothing to admire
them. He would not injure a plant unnecessarily. At
the time of the John Brown tragedy, Thoreau was
driven sick. So the country's misfortunes in the Union
war acted on his feelings with great force: he used to
say he 'could never recover while the war lasted.'"
Hawthorne had an experience somewhat similar,
though he, too, was of stern stuff when need was, and
had much of the old Salem sea-captains in his sensitive
nature.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO DANIEL RICKETSON (AT NEW BEDFORD).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, October 31, 1858.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Friend Ricketson</span>,&mdash;I have not seen anything of
your English author yet. Edward Hoar, my companion
in Maine and at the White Mountains, his sister Elizabeth,
and a Miss Prichard, another neighbor of ours,
went to Europe in the Niagara on the 6th. I told them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
to look out for you under the Yardley Oak, but it
seems they will not find you there.</p>

<p>I had a pleasant time in Tuckerman's Ravine at the
White Mountains in July, entertaining four beside myself
under my little tent through some soaking rains;
and more recently I have taken an interesting walk
with Channing about Cape Ann. We were obliged to
"dipper it" a good way, on account of the scarcity of
fresh water, for we got most of our meals by the shore.
Channing is understood to be here for the winter, but
I rarely see him.</p>

<p>I should be pleased to see your face here in the
course of the Indian summer, which may still be expected,
if any authority can tell us when that phenomenon
<i>does</i> occur. We would like to hear the story of
your travels; for if you have not been fairly intoxicated
with Europe, you have been half-seas-over, and so can
probably tell more about it.</p>

<p class="p2">This alludes to the fact that Ricketson got as far as
Halifax in his attempt at Europe; and in his reply
(November 3, 1858) he gave Thoreau an account of
his short voyage, on which the next letter comments.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO DANIEL RICKETSON (AT NEW BEDFORD).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, November 6, 1858.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Friend Ricketson</span>,&mdash;I was much pleased with your
lively and lifelike account of your voyage. You were
more than repaid for your trouble after all. The coast
of Nova Scotia, which you sailed along from Windsor
westward, is particularly interesting to the historian of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
this country, having been settled earlier than Plymouth.
Your "Isle of Haut" is properly "Isle Haute," or
the High Island of Champlain's map. There is another
off the coast of Maine. By the way, the American
elk of <i>American authors</i> (<i>Cervus Canadensis</i>) is a
distinct animal from the moose (<i>Cervus alces</i>), though
the latter is called elk by many.</p>

<p>You drew a very vivid portrait of the Australian,&mdash;short
and stout, with a pipe in his mouth, and his
book inspired by beer, Pot First, Pot Second, etc. I
suspect that he must be potbellied withal. Methinks I
see the smoke going up from him as from a cottage on
the moor. If he does not quench his genius with his
beer, it may burst into a clear flame at last. However,
perhaps he intentionally adopts the low style.</p>

<p>What do you mean by that ado about smoking, and
my "purer tastes"? I should like his pipe as well as
his beer at least. Neither of them is so bad as to be
"highly connected," which you say he is, unfortunately.
No! I expect nothing but pleasure in "smoke from
<i>your</i> pipe."</p>

<p>You and the Australian must have put your heads
together when you concocted those titles,&mdash;with pipes
in your mouths over a pot of beer. I suppose that your
chapters are, Whiff the First, Whiff the Second, etc.
But of course it is a more modest expression for "Fire
from my Genius."</p>

<p>You must have been very busy since you came back,
or before you sailed, to have brought out your History,
of whose publication I had not heard. I suppose that
I have read it in the <i>Mercury</i>. Yet I am curious to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
see how it looks in a volume, with your name on the
title-page.</p>

<p>I am more curious still about the poems. Pray put
some sketches into the book: your shanty for frontispiece;
Arthur and Walton's boat (if you can) running
for Cuttyhunk in a tremendous gale; not forgetting
"Be honest boys," etc., near by; the Middleborough
ponds with a certain island looming in the distance;
the Quaker meeting-house, and the Brady house, if
you like; the villagers catching smelts with dip-nets in
the twilight, at the Head of the River, etc., etc. Let it
be a local and villageous book as much as possible.
Let some one make a characteristic selection of mottoes
from your shanty walls, and sprinkle them in an
irregular manner, at all angles, over the fly-leaves and
margins, as a man stamps his name in a hurry; and
also canes, pipes, and jackknives, of all your patterns,
about the frontispiece. I can think of plenty of devices
for tail-pieces. Indeed, I should like to see a hair pillow,
accurately drawn, for one; a cat, with a bell on,
for another; the old horse, with his age printed in the
hollow of his back; half a cocoanut-shell by a spring;
a sheet of blotted paper; a settle occupied by a settler
at full length, etc., etc., etc. Call all the arts to your
aid.</p>

<p>Don't wait for the Indian summer, but bring it with
you.</p>

<p>P. S.&mdash;Let me ask a favor. I am trying to write
something about the autumnal tints, and I wish to
know how much our trees differ from English and
European ones in this respect. Will you observe, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
learn for me, what English or European trees, if any,
still retain their leaves in Mr. Arnold's garden (the gardener
will supply the true names); and also if the foliage
of any (and what) European or foreign trees there
have been brilliant the past month. If you will do this
you will greatly oblige me. I return the newspaper
with this.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO DANIEL RICKETSON (AT NEW BEDFORD).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, November 22, 1858.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Friend Ricketson</span>,&mdash;I thank you for your "History."<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>

Though I have not yet read it again, I have
looked far enough to see that I like the homeliness of
it; that is, the good, old-fashioned way of writing, as if
you actually lived where you wrote. A man's interest
in a single bluebird is worth more than a complete but
dry list of the fauna and flora of a town. It is also a
considerable advantage to be able to say at any time,
"If D. R. is not here, here is his book." Alcott being
here, and inquiring after you (whom he has been expecting),
I lent the book to him almost immediately.
He talks of going West the latter part of this week.
Channing is here again, as I am told, but I have not
seen him.</p>

<p>I thank you also for the account of the trees. It was
to my purpose, and I hope you got something out of it
too. I suppose that the cold weather prevented your
coming here. Suppose you try a winter walk on skates.
Please remember me to your family.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">Late in November, 1858, Cholmondeley, who had
not written for a year and six months, suddenly notified
Thoreau from Montreal that he was in Canada, and
would visit Concord the next week. Accordingly he
arrived early in December, and urged his friend to go
with him to the West Indies. John Thoreau, the father,
was then in his last illness, and for that and other reasons
Thoreau could not accept the invitation; but he
detained Cholmondeley in Concord some days, and
took him to New Bedford, December 8th, having first
written this note to Mr. Ricketson:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thomas Cholmondeley, my English acquaintance,
is here, on his way to the West Indies. He wants to
see New Bedford, a whaling town. I tell him I would
like to introduce him to you there,&mdash;thinking more of
his seeing you than New Bedford. So we propose to
come your way to-morrow. Excuse this short notice,
for the time is short. If on any account it is inconvenient
to see us, you will treat us accordingly."</p>

<p>Of this visit and his English visitor, Mr. Ricketson
wrote in his journal the next day:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We were all much pleased with Mr. Cholmondeley.
He is a tall spare man, thirty-five years of age, of fair
and fresh complexion, blue eyes, light-brown and fine
hair, nose small and Roman, beard light and worn full,
with a mustache. A man of fine culture and refinement
of manners, educated at Oriel College, Oxford, of an
old Cheshire family by his father, a clergyman. He
wore a black velvet sack coat, and lighter-colored
trousers,&mdash;a sort of genteel traveling suit; perhaps a
cap, but by no means a fashionable 'castor.' He reminded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
me of our dear friend, George William Curtis."
Few greater compliments could this diarist give than to
compare a visitor to Curtis, the lamented.</p>

<p>Mr. Cholmondeley left Concord for the South, going
as far as to Virginia, in December and January; then
came back to Concord the 20th of January, 1859, and
after a few days returned to Canada, and thence to
England by way of Jamaica. He was in London when
Theodore Parker reached there from Santa Cruz, in
June, and called on him, with offers of service; but
does not seem to have heard of Parker's death till I
wrote him in May, 1861. At my parting with him in
Concord, he gave me money with which to buy grapes
for the invalid father of Thoreau,&mdash;an instance of his
constant consideration for others; the Thoreaus hardly
affording such luxuries as hothouse grapes for the sick.
Sophia Thoreau, who perhaps was more appreciative
of him than her more stoical brother, said after his
death, "We have always had the truest regard for him,
as a person of rare integrity, great benevolence, and the
sincerest friendliness." This well describes the man
whose every-day guise was literally set down by Mr.
Ricketson.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, January 1, 1859.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Blake</span>,&mdash;It may interest you to hear that
Cholmondeley has been this way again, <i>via</i> Montreal
and Lake Huron, going to the West Indies, or rather
to Weiss-nicht-wo, whither he urges me to accompany
him. He is rather more demonstrative than before,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
and, on the whole, what would be called "a good fellow,"&mdash;is
a man of principle, and quite reliable, but
very peculiar. I have been to New Bedford with him,
to show him a whaling town and Ricketson. I was
glad to hear that you had called on R. How did you
like him? I suspect that you did not see one another
fairly.</p>

<p>I have lately got back to that glorious society called
Solitude, where we meet our friends continually, and
can imagine the outside world also to be peopled. Yet
some of my acquaintance would fain hustle me into the
almshouse for <i>the sake of society</i>, as if I were pining for
that diet, when I seem to myself a most befriended
man, and find constant employment. However, they
do not believe a word I say. They have got a club, the
handle of which is in the Parker House at Boston, and
with this they beat me from time to time, expecting to
make me tender or minced meat, so fit for a club to
dine off.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><p class="o1">
"Hercules with his club</p>
<p>The Dragon did drub;</p>
<p>But More of More Hall</p>
<p>With nothing at all,</p>
<p>He slew the Dragon of Wantley."</p></div></div>

<p>Ah! that More of More Hall knew what fair play was.
Channing, who wrote to me about it once, brandishing
the club vigorously (being set on by another, probably),
says <i>now</i>, seriously, that he is sorry to find by my
letters that I am "absorbed in politics," and adds,
begging my pardon for his plainness, "Beware of an
extraneous life!" and so he does his duty, and washes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
his hands of me. I tell him that it is as if he should
say to the sloth, that fellow that creeps so slowly along
a tree, and cries <i>ai</i> from time to time, "Beware of
dancing!"</p>

<p>The doctors are all agreed that I am suffering for
want of society. Was never a case like it. First, I did
not know that I was suffering at all. Secondly, as an
Irishman might say, I had thought it was indigestion
of the society I got.</p>

<p>As for the Parker House, I went there once, when
the Club<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
 was away, but I found it hard to see through
the cigar smoke, and men were deposited about in
chairs over the marble floor, as thick as legs of bacon
in a smoke-house. It was all smoke, and no salt, Attic
or other. The only room in Boston which I visit with
alacrity is the Gentlemen's Room at the Fitchburg Depot,
where I wait for the cars, sometimes for two hours,
in order to get out of town. It is a paradise to the
Parker House, for no smoking is allowed, and there is
far more retirement. A large and respectable club of
us hire it (Town and Country Club), and I am pretty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
sure to find some one there whose face is set the same
way as my own.</p>

<p>My last essay, on which I am still engaged, is called
"Autumnal Tints." I do not know how readable (<i>i. e.</i>,
by me to others) it will be.</p>

<p>I met Mr. James the other night at Emerson's, at an
Alcottian conversation, at which, however, Alcott did
not talk much, being disturbed by James's opposition.
The latter is a hearty man enough, with whom you can
differ very satisfactorily, on account of both his doctrines
and his good temper. He utters <i>quasi</i> philanthropic
dogmas in a metaphysic dress; but they are for
all practical purposes very crude. He charges society
with all the crime committed, and praises the criminal
for committing it. But I think that all the remedies
he suggests out of his head&mdash;for he goes no farther,
hearty as he is&mdash;would leave us about where we are
now. For, of course, it is not by a gift of turkeys on
Thanksgiving Day that he proposes to convert the criminal,
but by a true sympathy with each one,&mdash;with him,
among the rest, who lyingly tells the world from the
gallows that he has never been treated kindly by a single
mortal since he was born. But it is not so easy a thing
to sympathize with another, though you may have the
best disposition to do it. There is Dobson over the hill.
Have not you and I and all the world been trying, ever
since he was born, to sympathize with him? (as doubtless
he with us), and yet we have got no farther than
to send him to the house of correction once at least;
and he, on the other hand, as I hear, has sent us to
another place several times. This is the real state of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
things, as I understand it, at least so far as James's
remedies go. We are now, alas! exercising what charity
we actually have, and new laws would not give us
any more. But, perchance, we might make some improvements
in the house of correction. You and I are
Dobson; what will James do for us?</p>

<p>Have you found at last in your wanderings a place
where the solitude is sweet?</p>

<p>What mountain are you camping on nowadays?
Though I had a good time at the mountains, I confess
that the journey did not bear any fruit that I know of.
I did not expect it would. The mode of it was not
simple and adventurous enough. You must first have
made an infinite demand, and not unreasonably, but
after a corresponding outlay, have an all-absorbing
purpose, and at the same time that your feet bear you
hither and thither, travel much more in imagination.</p>

<p>To let the mountains slide,&mdash;live at home like a
traveler. It should not be in vain that these things are
shown us from day to day. Is not each withered leaf
that I see in my walks something which I have traveled
to find?&mdash;traveled, who can tell how far? What a
fool he must be who thinks that his El Dorado is anywhere
but where he lives!</p>

<p>We are always, methinks, in some kind of ravine,
though our bodies may walk the smooth streets of
Worcester. Our souls (I use this word for want of a
better) are ever perched on its rocky sides, overlooking
that lowland. (What a more than Tuckerman's
Ravine is the body itself, in which the "soul" is encamped,
when you come to look into it! However,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
eagles always have chosen such places for their
eyries.)</p>

<p>Thus is it ever with your fair cities of the plain.
Their streets may be paved with silver and gold, and
six carriages roll abreast in them, but the real <i>homes</i> of
the citizens are in the Tuckerman's Ravines which ray
out from that centre into the mountains round about,
one from each man, woman, and child. The masters
of life have so ordered it. That is their <i>beau-ideal</i> of a
country-seat. There is no danger of being <i>tuckered</i> out
before you get to it.</p>

<p>So we live in Worcester and in Concord, each man
taking his exercise regularly in his ravine, like a lion
in his cage, and sometimes spraining his ankle there.
We have very few clear days, and a great many small
plagues which keep us busy. Sometimes, I suppose,
you hear a neighbor halloo (Brown, maybe) and think
it is a bear. Nevertheless, on the whole, we think it
very grand and exhilarating, this ravine life. It is a
capital advantage withal, living so high, the excellent
drainage of that city of God. Routine is but a shallow
and insignificant sort of ravine, such as the ruts are,
the conduits of puddles. But these ravines are the source
of mighty streams, precipitous, icy, savage, as they are,
haunted by bears and loup-cerviers; there are born not
only Sacos and Amazons, but prophets who will redeem
the world. The at last smooth and fertilizing water at
which nations drink and navies supply themselves begins
with melted glaciers, and burst thunder-spouts.
Let us pray that, if we are not flowing through some
Mississippi valley which we fertilize,&mdash;and it is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
likely we are,&mdash;we may know ourselves shut in between
grim and mighty mountain walls amid the clouds, falling
a thousand feet in a mile, through dwarfed fir and
spruce, over the rocky insteps of slides, being exercised
in our minds, and so developed.</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, January 19, 1859.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Blake</span>,&mdash;If I could have given a favorable
report as to the skating, I should have answered you
earlier. About a week before you wrote there was good
skating; there is now none. As for the lecture, I shall
be glad to come. I cannot now say when, but I will let
you know, I think within a week or ten days at most,
and will then leave you a week clear to make the
arrangements in. I will bring something else than
"What shall it profit a Man?" My father is very sick,
and has been for a long time, so that there is the more
need of me at home. This occurs to me, even when
contemplating so short an excursion as to Worcester.</p>

<p>I want very much to see or hear your account of
your adventures in the Ravine,<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
 and I trust I shall do
so when I come to Worcester. Cholmondeley has been
here again, returning from Virginia (for he went no
farther south) to Canada; and will go thence to Europe,
he thinks, in the spring, and never ramble any more.
(January 29.) I am expecting daily that my father
will die, therefore I cannot leave home at present. I
will write you again within ten days.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">The death of John Thoreau (who was born October
8, 1787) occurred February 3d, and Thoreau gave his
lecture on "Autumnal Tints" at Worcester, February
22, 1859. Mrs. Thoreau survived all her children except
Sophia, and died in 1872.</p>

<p>At his fathers death, Thoreau sent a newspaper announcement
of it to Ricketson, who had already seen it
mentioned by Channing in the <i>Mercury</i>. Ricketson at
once wrote, to pay his tribute to the character of the
elder Thoreau, saying: "I have rarely met a man who
inspired me with more respect. I remember with pleasure
a ramble I took with him about Concord some two
or three years ago, at a time when you were away from
home; on which occasion I was much impressed with
his good sense, his fine social nature, and his genuine
hospitality." Of this remark Thoreau took notice in his
interesting reply.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO DANIEL RICKETSON (AT NEW BEDFORD).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, 12th February, 1859.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Friend Ricketson</span>,&mdash;I thank you for your kind letter.
I sent you the notice of my father's death as much
because you knew him as because you knew me. I can
hardly realize that he is dead. He had been sick about
two years, and at last declined rather rapidly, though
steadily. Till within a week or ten days before he died
he was hoping to see another spring, but he then discovered
that this was a vain expectation, and, thinking
that he was dying, he took his leave of us several times
within a week before his departure. Once or twice he
expressed a slight impatience at the delay. He was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
quite conscious to the last, and his death was so easy
that, though we had all been sitting around the bed for
an hour or more expecting that event (as we had sat
before), he was gone at last, almost before we were
aware of it.</p>

<p>I am glad to read what you say of his social nature.
I think I may say that he was wholly unpretending;
and there was this peculiarity in his aim, that though
he had pecuniary difficulties to contend with the greater
part of his life, he always studied how to make a <i>good</i>
article, pencil or other (for he practiced various arts),
and was never satisfied with what he had produced.
Nor was he ever disposed in the least to put off a poor
one for the sake of pecuniary gain,&mdash;as if he labored
for a higher end.</p>

<p>Though he was not very old, and was not a native
of Concord, I think that he was, on the whole, more
identified with Concord street than any man now alive,
having come here when he was about twelve years old,
and set up for himself as a merchant here, at the age
of twenty-one, fifty years ago. As I sat in a circle the
other evening with my mother and sister, my mother's
two sisters, and my father's two sisters, it occurred to
me that my father, though seventy-one, belonged to
the youngest four of the eight who recently composed
our family.</p>

<p>How swiftly at last, but unnoticed, a generation
passes away! Three years ago I was called with my
father to be a witness to the signing of our neighbor
Mr. Frost's will. Mr. Samuel Hoar, who was there
writing it, also signed it. I was lately required to go to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
Cambridge to testify to the genuineness of the will,
being the only one of the four who could be there, and
now I am the only one alive.</p>

<p>My mother and sister thank you heartily for your
sympathy. The latter, in particular, agrees with you
in thinking that it is communion with still living and
healthy nature alone which can restore to sane and
cheerful views. I thank you for your invitation to New
Bedford, but I feel somewhat confined here for the
present.</p>

<p>I did not know but we should see you the day after
Alger was here. It is not too late for a winter walk in
Concord. It does me good to hear of spring birds, and
singing ones too,&mdash;for spring seems far away from
Concord yet. I am going to Worcester to read a parlor
lecture on the 22d, and shall see Blake and Brown.
What if you were to meet me there, or go with me
from here? You would see them to good advantage.
Cholmondeley has been here again, after going as far
south as Virginia, and left for Canada about three
weeks ago. He is a good soul, and I am afraid I did
not sufficiently recognize him.</p>

<p>Please remember me to Mrs. Ricketson, and to the
rest of your family.</p>

<p class="p2">A long silence had passed on Thoreau's part before he
wrote again to Ricketson,&mdash;nearly two years, in fact,&mdash;and
his friend complained of it. He had followed
the public utterances of Thoreau with entire sympathy,
although much in advance, in 1859-60, of public
opinion respecting John Brown and slavery, and he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
sent him letters and complimentary verses. Finally, he
almost implored Thoreau to renew the bond of friendship.
This will explain the tenor of Thoreau's reply.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO DANIEL RICKETSON, (AT NEW BEDFORD).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, November 4, 1860.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Friend Ricketson</span>,&mdash;I thank you for the verses.
They are quite too good to apply to me. However, I
know what a poet's license is, and will not get in the
way.</p>

<p>But what do you mean by that prose? Why will you
waste so many regards on me, and not know what to
think of my silence? Infer from it what you might
from the silence of a dense pine wood. It is its natural
condition, except when the winds blow, and the jays
scream, and the chickadee winds up his clock. My
silence is just as inhuman as that, and no more. You
know that I never promised to correspond with you,
and so, when I do, I do more than I promised.</p>

<p>Such are my pursuits and habits that I rarely go
abroad; and it is quite a habit with me to decline invitations
to do so. Not that I could not enjoy such visits,
if I were not otherwise occupied. I have enjoyed very
much my visits to you, and my rides in your neighborhood,
and am sorry that I cannot enjoy such things
oftener; but life is short, and there are other things
also to be done. I admit that you are more social than
I am and far more attentive to "the common courtesies
of life;" but this is partly for the reason that you
have fewer or less exacting private pursuits.</p>

<p>Not to have written a note for a year is with me a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
very venial offense. I think that I do not correspond
with any one so often as once in six months.</p>

<p>I have a faint recollection of your invitation referred
to; but I suppose that I had no new nor particular reason
for declining, and so made no new statement. I
have felt that you would be glad to see me almost
whenever I got ready to come; but I only offer myself
as a rare visitor, and a still rarer correspondent.</p>

<p>I am very busy, after my fashion, little as there is to
show for it, and feel as if I could not spend many days
nor dollars in traveling; for the shortest visit must have
a fair margin to it, and the days thus affect the weeks,
you know. Nevertheless, we cannot forego these luxuries
altogether. You must not regard me as a regular
diet, but at most only as acorns, which, too, are not to
be despised,&mdash;which, at least, we love to think are
edible in a bracing walk. We have got along pretty
well together in several directions, though we are such
strangers in others.</p>

<p>I hardly know what to say in answer to your letter.
Some are accustomed to write many letters, others very
few. I am one of the last. At any rate, we are pretty
sure, if we write at all, to send those thoughts which
we cherish, to that one who, we believe, will most religiously
attend to them.</p>

<p>This life is not for complaint, but for satisfaction. I
do not feel addressed by this letter of yours. It suggests
only misunderstanding. Intercourse may be good;
but of what use are complaints and apologies? Any
complaint <i>I</i> have to make is too serious to be uttered,
for the evil cannot be mended.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span></p>

<p>Turn over a new leaf.</p>

<p>My outdoor harvest this fall has been one Canada
lynx, a fierce-looking fellow, which, it seems, we have
hereabouts; eleven barrels of apples from trees of my
own planting; and a large crop of white oak acorns,
which I did not raise.</p>

<p>Please remember me to your family. I have a very
pleasant recollection of your fireside, and I trust that
I shall revisit it;&mdash;also of your shanty and the surrounding
regions.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, September 26, 1859.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Blake</span>,&mdash;I am not sure that I am in a fit mood
to write to you, for I feel and think rather too much like
a business man, having some very irksome affairs to attend
to these months and years on account of my family.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>

This is the way I am serving King Admetus, confound
him! If it were not for my relations, I would let the
wolves prey on his flocks to their bellies' content. Such
fellows you have to deal with! herdsmen of some other
king, or of the same, who tell no tale, but in the sense
of counting their flocks, and then lie drunk under a
hedge. How is your grist ground? Not by some murmuring
stream, while you lie dreaming on the bank;
but, it seems, you must take hold with your hands, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
shove the wheel round. You can't depend on streams,
poor feeble things! You can't depend on worlds, left
to themselves; but you've got to oil them and goad
them along. In short, you've got to carry on two farms
at once,&mdash;the farm on the earth and the farm in your
mind. Those Crimean and Italian battles were mere
boys' play,&mdash;they are the scrapes into which truants
get. But what a battle a man must fight everywhere
to maintain his standing army of thoughts, and march
with them in orderly array through the always hostile
country! How many enemies there are to sane thinking!
Every soldier has succumbed to them before he
enlists for those other battles. Men may sit in chambers,
seemingly safe and sound, and yet despair, and
turn out at last only hollowness and dust within, like a
Dead Sea apple. A standing army of numerous, brave,
and well-disciplined thoughts, and you at the head of
them, marching straight to your goal,&mdash;how to bring
this about is the problem, and Scott's Tactics will not
help you to it. Think of a poor fellow begirt only with
a sword-belt, and no such staff of athletic thoughts! his
brains rattling as he walks and <i>talks</i>! These are your
prætorian guard. It is easy enough to maintain a family,
or a state, but it is hard to maintain these children
of your brain (or say, rather, these guests that
trust to enjoy your hospitality), they make such great
demands; and yet, he who does only the former, and
loses the power to <i>think</i> originally, or as only he ever
can, fails miserably. Keep up the fires of thought, and
all will go well.</p>

<p>Zouaves?&mdash;pish! How you can overrun a country,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
climb any rampart, and carry any fortress, with an
army of <i>alert</i> thoughts!&mdash;thoughts that send their bullets
home to heaven's door,&mdash;with which you can <i>take</i>
the whole world, without paying for it, or robbing anybody.
See, the conquering hero comes! You <i>fail</i> in
your thoughts, or you <i>prevail</i> in your thoughts only.
Provided you <i>think</i> well, the heavens falling, or the
earth gaping, will be the music for you to march by.
No foe can ever see you, or you him; you cannot so
much as <i>think</i> of him. Swords have no edges, bullets
no penetration, for such a contest. In your mind must
be a liquor which will dissolve the world whenever it is
dropt in it. There is no universal solvent but this, and
all things together cannot saturate it. It will hold the
universe in solution, and yet be as translucent as ever.
The vast machine may indeed roll over our toes, and
we not know it, but it would rebound and be staved to
pieces like an empty barrel, if it should strike fair and
square on the smallest and least angular of a man's
thoughts.</p>

<p>You seem not to have taken Cape Cod the right way.
I think that you should have persevered in walking on
the beach and on the bank, even to the land's end, however
soft, and so, by long knocking at Ocean's gate,
have gained admittance at last,&mdash;better, if separately,
and in a storm, not knowing where you would sleep by
night, or eat by day. Then you should have given a
day to the sand behind Provincetown, and ascended
the hills there, and been blown on considerably. I hope
that you like to remember the journey better than you
did to make it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span></p>

<p>I have been confined at home all this year, but I am
not aware that I have grown any rustier than was to be
expected. One while I explored the bottom of the river
pretty extensively. I have engaged to read a lecture to
Parker's society on the 9th of October next.</p>

<p>I am off&mdash;a-barberrying.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, October 31, 1859.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Blake</span>,&mdash;I spoke to my townsmen last evening
on "The Character of Captain Brown, now in the
Clutches of the Slaveholder." I should like to speak to
any company at Worcester who may wish to hear me;
and will come if only my expenses are paid. I think
we should express ourselves at once, while Brown is
alive. The sooner the better. Perhaps Higginson may
like to have a meeting. Wednesday evening would
be a good time. The people here are deeply interested
in the matter. Let me have an answer as soon as
may be.</p>

<p>P. S.&mdash;I may be engaged toward the end of the
week.</p>

<p class="left65">
<span class="smcap">Henry D. Thoreau.</span></p>

<p>This address on John Brown was one of the first
public utterances in favor of that hero; it was made up
mainly from the entries in Thoreau's journals, since I
had introduced Brown to him, and he to Emerson, in
March, 1857; and especially from those pages that
Thoreau had written after the news of Brown's capture
in Virginia had reached him. It was first given in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
vestry of the old parish church in Concord (where, in
1774, the Provincial Congress of Massachusetts had
met to prepare for armed resistance to British tyranny);
was repeated at Worcester the same week, and before a
great audience in Boston, the following Sunday,&mdash;after
which it was published in the newspapers, and had a
wide reading. Mr. Alcott in his diary mentions it under
date of Sunday, October 30, thus: "Thoreau reads a
paper on John Brown, his virtues, spirit, and deeds, this
evening, and to the delight of his company,&mdash;the best
that could be gathered at short notice,&mdash;and among
them Emerson. (November 4.) Thoreau calls and reports
about the reading of his lecture on Brown at
Boston and Worcester. He has been the first to speak
and celebrate the hero's courage and magnanimity; it
is these that he discerns and praises. The men have
much in common,&mdash;the sturdy manliness, straightforwardness,
and independence. (November 5.) Ricketson
from New Bedford arrives; he and Thoreau take
supper with us. Thoreau talks freely and enthusiastically
about Brown,&mdash;denouncing the Union, the President,
the States, and Virginia particularly; wishes to
publish his late speech, and has seen Boston publishers,
but failed to find any to print it for him." It was soon
after published, along with Emerson's two speeches in
favor of Brown, by a new Boston publishing house
(Thayer &amp; Eldridge), in a volume called "Echoes
of Harper's Ferry," edited by the late James Redpath,
Brown's first biographer. In the following summer,
Thoreau sent a second paper on Brown (written soon
after his execution) to be read at a commemoration of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
the martyr, beside his grave among the Adirondack
Mountains. This is mentioned in his letter to Sophia
Thoreau, July 8, 1860. He took an active part in arranging
for the funeral service in honor of Brown, at
Concord, the day of his death, December 2, 1859.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, May 20, 1860.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Blake</span>,&mdash;I must endeavor to pay some of my
debts to you. To begin where we left off, then.</p>

<p>The presumption is that <i>we</i> are always the same;
our opportunities, and Nature herself, fluctuating. Look
at mankind. No great difference between two, apparently;
perhaps the same height, and breadth, and
weight; and yet, to the man who sits most east, this life
is a weariness, routine, dust and ashes, and he drowns
his imaginary <i>cares</i> (!) (a sort of friction among his
vital organs) in a bowl. But to the man who sits most
west, his <i>contemporary</i> (!), it is a field for all noble endeavors,
an elysium, the dwelling-place of heroes and
demigods. The former complains that he has a thousand
affairs to attend to; but he does not realize that
his affairs (though they may be a thousand) and he
are one.</p>

<p>Men and boys are learning all kinds of trades but
how to make <i>men</i> of themselves. They learn to make
houses; but they are not so well housed, they are not
so contented in their houses, as the woodchucks in their
holes. What is the use of a house if you haven't got a
tolerable planet to put it on?&mdash;if you cannot tolerate
the planet it is on? Grade the ground first. If a man

believes and expects great things of himself, it makes
no odds where you put him, or what you show him (of
course <i>you</i> cannot put him anywhere, nor show him
anything), he will be surrounded by grandeur. He is
in the condition of a healthy and hungry man, who
says to himself,&mdash;How sweet this crust is! If he despairs
of himself, then Tophet is his dwelling-place, and
he is in the condition of a sick man who is disgusted
with the fruits of finest flavor.</p>

<p>Whether he sleeps or wakes,&mdash;whether he runs or
walks,&mdash;whether he uses a microscope or a telescope,
or his naked eye,&mdash;a man never discovers anything,
never overtakes anything, or leaves anything behind,
but himself. Whatever he says or does, he merely reports
himself. If he is in love, he <i>loves</i>; if he is in
heaven, he <i>enjoys</i>; if he is in hell, he <i>suffers</i>. It is his
condition that determines his locality.</p>

<p>The principal, the only, thing a man makes, is his
condition of fate. Though commonly he does not know
it, nor put up a sign to this effect, "My own destiny
made and mended here." (Not <i>yours</i>.) He is a master
workman in the business. He works twenty-four hours
a day at it, and gets it done. Whatever else he neglects
or botches, no man was ever known to neglect this
work. A great many pretend to make <i>shoes</i> chiefly,
and would scout the idea that they make the hard
times which they experience.</p>

<p>Each reaching and aspiration is an instinct with
which all nature consists and coöperates, and therefore
it is not in vain. But alas! each relaxing and desperation
is an instinct too. To be active, well, happy, implies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
rare courage. To be ready to fight in a duel or a
battle implies desperation, or that you hold your life
cheap.</p>

<p>If you take this life to be simply what old religious
folks pretend (I mean the effete, gone to seed in a
drought, mere human galls stung by the devil once),
then all your joy and serenity is reduced to grinning
and bearing it. The fact is, you have got to take the
world on your shoulders like Atlas, and "put along"
with it. You will do this for an idea's sake, and your
success will be in proportion to your devotion to ideas.
It may make your back ache occasionally, but you will
have the satisfaction of hanging it or twirling it to suit
yourself. Cowards suffer, heroes enjoy. After a long
day's walk with it, pitch it into a hollow place, sit down
and eat your luncheon. Unexpectedly, by some immortal
thoughts, you will be compensated. The bank
whereon you sit will be a fragrant and flowery one, and
your world in the hollow a sleek and light gazelle.</p>

<p>Where is the "unexplored land" but in our own
untried enterprises? To an adventurous spirit any
place&mdash;London, New York, Worcester, or his own
yard&mdash;is "unexplored land," to seek which Frémont
and Kane travel so far. To a sluggish and defeated
spirit even the Great Basin and the Polaris are trivial
places. If they can get there (and, indeed, they are
there now), they will want to sleep, and give it up, just
as they always do. These are the regions of the Known
and of the Unknown. What is the use of going right
over the old track again? There is an adder in the
path which your own feet have worn. You must make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
tracks into the Unknown. That is what you have your
board and clothes for. Why do you ever mend your
clothes, unless that, wearing them, you may mend your
ways? Let us sing.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO SOPHIA THOREAU (AT CAMPTON, N. H.).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, July 8, 1860.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sophia</span>,&mdash;Mother reminds me that I must
write to you, if only a few lines, though I have sprained
my thumb, so that it is questionable whether I can
write legibly, if at all. I can't "bear on" much. What
is worse, I believe that I have sprained my brain too&mdash;that
is, it sympathizes with my thumb. But that is no
excuse, I suppose, for writing a letter in such a case is
like sending a newspaper, only a hint to let you know
that "all is well,"&mdash;but my thumb.</p>

<p>I hope that you begin to derive some benefit from
that more mountainous air which you are breathing.
Have you had a distinct view of the Franconia Notch
Mountains (blue peaks in the northern horizon)?
which I told you you could get from the road in Campton,
probably from some other points nearer. Such a
view of the mountains is more memorable than any
other. Have you been to Squam Lake or overlooked
it? I should think that you could make an excursion
to some mountain in that direction from which you
could see the lake and mountains generally. Is there
no friend of N. P. Rogers who can tell you where the
"lions" are?</p>

<p>Of course I did not go to North Elba,<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
 but I sent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
some reminiscences of last fall. I hear that John Brown,
Jr., has now come to Boston for a few days. Mr. Sanborn's
case, it is said, will come on after some murder
cases have been disposed of here.</p>

<p>I have just been invited formally to be present at
the annual picnic of Theodore Parker's society (that
was), at Waverley, next Wednesday, and to make some
remarks. But that is wholly out of my line. I do not
go to picnics, even in Concord, you know.</p>

<p>Mother and Aunt Sophia rode to Acton in time yesterday.
I suppose that you have heard that Mr. Hawthorne
has come home. I went to meet him the other
evening and found that he has not altered, except that
he was looking quite brown after his voyage. He is as
simple and childlike as ever.</p>

<p>I believe that I have fairly scared the kittens away,
at last, by my pretended fierceness, which was. I will
consider my thumb&mdash;and your eyes.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, August 3, 1860.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Blake</span>,&mdash;I some time ago asked Channing if
he would not spend a week with me on Monadnock;
but he did not answer decidedly. Lately he has talked
of an excursion somewhere, but I said that <i>now</i> I must
wait till my sister returned from Plymouth, N. H.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
She has returned,&mdash;and accordingly, on receiving your
note this morning, I made known its contents to Channing,
in order to see how far I was engaged with him.
The result is that he decides to go to Monadnock to-morrow
morning;<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
 so I must defer making an excursion
with you and Brown to another season. Perhaps
you will call as you pass the mountain. I send this by
the earliest mail.</p>

<p>P. S.&mdash;That was a very insufficient visit which you
made here the last time. My mother is better, though
far from well; and if you should chance along here
any time after your journey, I trust that we shall all
do better.</p>

<p class="p2">The mention by Thoreau of John Brown and my
"case" recalls to me an incident of those excited days
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
which followed the attack by Brown on slavery in Virginia.
The day after Brown's death, but before the
execution of his comrades, I received a message from
the late Dr. David Thayer of Boston, implying, as I
thought, that a son of Brown was at his house, whither
I hurried to meet him. Instead, I found young F. J.
Merriam of Boston, who had escaped with Owen Brown
from Harper's Ferry, and was now in Boston to raise
another party against the slaveholders. He was unfit
to lead or even join in such a desperate undertaking,
and we insisted he should return to safety in Canada,&mdash;a
large reward being offered for his seizure. He
agreed to go back to Canada that night by the Fitchburg
Railroad; but in his hot-headed way he took the
wrong train, which ran no farther than Concord,&mdash;and
found himself in the early evening at my house,
where my sister received him, but insisted that I should
not see him, lest I might be questioned about my guest.
While he had supper and went to bed, I posted down
to Mr. Emerson's and engaged his horse and covered
wagon, to be ready at sunrise,&mdash;he asking no questions.
In the same way I engaged Mr. Thoreau to drive his
friend's horse to South Acton the next morning, and
there put on board the first Canadian train a Mr. Lockwood,
whom he would find at my house. Thoreau
readily consented, asked no questions, walked to the
Emerson stable the next morning, found the horse
ready, drove him to my door, and took up Merriam,
under the name of Lockwood,&mdash;neither knowing who
the other was. Merriam was so flighty that, though he
had agreed to go to Montreal, and knew that his life
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
might depend on getting there early, he declared he
must see Mr. Emerson, to lay before him his plan for invading
the South, and consult him about some moral
questions that troubled his mind. His companion listened
gravely,&mdash;and hurried the horse towards Acton.
Merriam grew more positive and suspicious,&mdash;"Perhaps
<span class="smcap">you</span> are Mr. Emerson; you look somewhat like
him."<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
 "No, I am not," said Thoreau, and drove steadily
away from Concord. "Well, then, I am going back,"
said the youth, and flung himself out of the wagon.
How Thoreau got him in again, he never told me; but
I suspected some judicious force, accompanying the
grave persuasive speech natural to our friend. At any
rate, he took his man to Acton, saw him safe on the
train, and reported to me that "Mr. Lockwood had
taken passage for Canada," where he arrived that
night. Nothing more passed between us until, more
than two years after, he inquired one day, in his last
illness, who my fugitive was. Merriam was then out of
danger in that way, and had been for months a soldier
in the Union army, where he died. I therefore said
that "Lockwood" was the grandson of his mother's
old friend, Francis Jackson, and had escaped from
Maryland. In return he gave me the odd incidents of
their drive, and mentioned that he had spoken of the
affair to his mother only since his illness. So reticent
and practically useful could he be; as Channing says,
"He made no useless professions, never asked one of
those questions which destroy all relation; but he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
on the spot at the time, he meant friendship, and meant
nothing else, and stood by it without the slightest
abatement."</p>

<p class="center p2">TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, November 4, 1860.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Blake</span>,&mdash;I am glad to hear any particulars of
your excursion. As for myself, I looked out for you
somewhat on that Monday, when, it appears, you
passed Monadnock; turned my glass upon several parties
that were ascending the mountain half a mile on
one side of us. In short, I came as near to seeing you
as you to seeing me. I have no doubt that we should
have had a good time if you had come, for I had, all
ready, two good spruce houses, in which you could
stand up, complete in all respects, half a mile apart,
and you and B. could have lodged by yourselves in one,
if not with us.</p>

<p>We made an excellent beginning of our mountain
life.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
 You may remember that the Saturday previous
was a stormy day. Well, we went up in the rain,&mdash;wet
through,&mdash;and found ourselves in a cloud there at
mid-afternoon, in no situation to look about for the
best place for a camp. So I proceeded at once, through
the cloud, to that memorable stone, "chunk yard," in
which we made our humble camp once, and there, after
putting our packs under a rock, having a good hatchet,
I proceeded to build a substantial house, which Channing
declared the handsomest he ever saw. (He never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
camped out before, and was, no doubt, prejudiced in
its favor.) This was done about dark, and by that time
we were nearly as wet as if we had stood in a hogshead
of water. We then built a fire before the door, directly
on the site of our little camp of two years ago, and it
took a long time to burn through its remains to the
earth beneath. Standing before this, and turning round
slowly, like meat that is roasting, we were as dry, if
not drier, than ever, after a few hours, and so at last
we "turned in."</p>

<p>This was a great deal better than going up there in
fair weather, and having no adventure (not knowing
how to appreciate either fair weather or foul) but dull,
commonplace sleep in a useless house, and before a
comparatively useless fire,&mdash;such as we get every night.
Of course we thanked our stars, when we saw them,
which was about midnight, that they had seemingly
withdrawn for a season. We had the mountain all to
ourselves that afternoon and night. There was nobody
going up that day to engrave his name on the summit,
nor to gather blueberries. The genius of the mountains
saw us starting from Concord, and it said, There
come two of our folks. Let us get ready for them. Get
up a serious storm, that will send a-packing these holiday
guests. (They may have their say another time.)
Let us receive them with true mountain hospitality,&mdash;kill
the fatted cloud. Let them know the value of a
spruce roof, and of a fire of dead spruce stumps. Every
bush dripped tears of joy at our advent. Fire did its
best, and received our thanks. What could fire have
done in fair weather? Spruce roof got its share of our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
blessings. And then, such a view of the wet rocks,
with the wet lichens on them, as we had the next morning,
but did not get again!</p>

<p>We and the mountain had a sound season, as the
saying is. How glad we were to be wet, in order that
we might be dried! How glad we were of the storm
which made our house seem like a new home to us!
This day's experience was indeed lucky, for we did not
have a thunder-shower during all our stay. Perhaps
our host reserved this attention in order to tempt us to
come again.</p>

<p>Our next house was more substantial still. One side
was rock, good for durability; the floor the same; and
the roof which I made would have upheld a horse. I
stood on it to do the shingling.</p>

<p>I noticed, when I was at the White Mountains last,
several nuisances which render traveling thereabouts
unpleasant. The chief of these was the mountain
houses. I might have supposed that the main attraction
of that region, even to citizens, lay in its wildness
and unlikeness to the city, and yet they make it as
much like the city as they can afford to. I heard that
the Crawford House was lighted with gas, and had a
large saloon, with its band of music, for dancing. But
give me a spruce house made in the rain.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i-417" id="i-417"></a>
<img src="images/i-417.jpg" width="550" height="344" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>From the Summit of Monadnock</i></p>
</div>

<p>An old Concord farmer tells me that he ascended
Monadnock once, and danced on the top. How did that
happen? Why, he being up there, a party of young
men and women came up, bringing boards and a fiddler;
and, having laid down the boards, they made a
level floor, on which they danced to the music of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
fiddle. I suppose the tune was "Excelsior." This reminds
me of the fellow who climbed to the top of a
very high spire, stood upright on the ball, and hurrahed
for&mdash;what? Why, for Harrison and Tyler. That's
the kind of sound which most ambitious people emit
when they culminate. They are wont to be singularly
frivolous in the thin atmosphere; they can't contain
themselves, though our comfort and their safety require
it; it takes the pressure of many atmospheres to do
this; and hence they helplessly evaporate there. It
would seem that as they ascend, they breathe shorter
and shorter, and, at each <i>expiration</i>, some of their wits
leave them, till, when they reach the pinnacle, they are
so light-headed as to be fit only to show how the wind
sits. I suspect that Emerson's criticism called "Monadnoc"
was inspired, not by remembering the inhabitants
of New Hampshire as they are in the valleys,
so much as by meeting some of them on the mountain-top.</p>

<p>After several nights' experience, Channing came to
the conclusion that he was "lying outdoors," and inquired
what was the largest beast that might nibble his
legs there. I fear that he did not improve all the night,
as he might have done, to sleep. I had asked him to
go and spend a week there. We spent five nights, being
gone six days, for C. suggested that six working days
made a week, and I saw that he was ready to <i>decamp</i>.
However, he found his account in it as well as I.</p>

<p>We were seen to go up in the rain, grim and silent,
like two genii of the storm, by Fassett's men or boys;
but we were never identified afterward, though we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
were the subject of some conversation which we overheard.
Five hundred persons at least came on to the
mountain while we were there, but not one found our
camp. We saw one party of three ladies and two gentlemen
spread their blankets and spend the night on
the top, and heard them converse; but they did not
know that they had neighbors who were comparatively
old settlers. We spared them the chagrin which that
knowledge would have caused them, and let them print
their story in a newspaper accordingly.</p>

<p>Yes, to meet men on an honest and simple footing,
meet with rebuffs, suffer from sore feet, as you did,&mdash;ay,
and from a sore heart, as perhaps you also did,&mdash;all
that is excellent. What a pity that that young prince<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>

could not enjoy a little of the legitimate experience of
traveling&mdash;be dealt with simply and truly, though
rudely. He might have been invited to some hospitable
house in the country, had his bowl of bread and milk
set before him, with a clean pinafore; been told that
there were the punt and the fishing-rod, and he could
amuse himself as he chose; might have swung a few
birches, dug out a woodchuck, and had a regular good
time, and finally been sent to bed with the boys,&mdash;and
so never have been introduced to Mr. Everett at all. I
have no doubt that this would have been a far more
memorable and valuable experience than he got.</p>

<p>The snow-clad summit of Mt. Washington must
have been a very interesting sight from Wachusett.
How wholesome winter is, seen far or near; how good,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
above all mere sentimental, warm-blooded, short-lived,
soft-hearted, <i>moral</i> goodness, commonly so called. Give
me the goodness which has forgotten its own deeds,&mdash;which
God has seen to be good, and let be. None of
your <i>just made perfect</i>,&mdash;pickled eels! All that will
save them will be their picturesqueness, as with blasted
trees. Whatever is, and is not ashamed to be, is good.
I value no moral goodness or greatness unless it is good
or great, even as that snowy peak is. Pray, how could
thirty feet of bowels improve it? Nature is goodness
crystallized. You looked into the land of promise.
Whatever beauty we behold, the more it is distant,
serene, and cold, the purer and more durable it is. It
is better to warm ourselves with ice than with fire.</p>

<p>Tell Brown that he sent me more than the price of
the book, viz., a word from himself, for which I am
greatly his debtor.</p>

<p class="p2">Thoreau began to be more seriously ill than he had
been for some years, early in December, 1860. He exposed
himself unduly in one of his walks, while counting
the rings on stumps of trees, amid snow. He
ceased much of his small activity of letter-writing; but,
in addressing Ricketson the next spring, he took the
unusual pains of writing him a letter of some length
which he never sent. It was found among his papers
after death,&mdash;the first draft of it, which ran as follows,
but was left a fragment:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">TO DANIEL RICKETSON (AT NEW BEDFORD).</p>

<p class="address">
Concord, March 19, 1861.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Friend R</span>,&mdash;Your letter reached me in due time, but
I had already heard the bluebirds. They were here on
the 26th of February at least,&mdash;but not yet do the larks
sing or the flickers call, with us. The bluebirds come
again, as does the same spring, but it does not find the
same mortals here to greet it. You remember Minott's
cottage on the hillside,&mdash;well, it finds some change
there, for instance. The little gray hip-roofed cottage
was occupied at the beginning of February, this year,
by George Minott and his sister Mary, respectively 78
and 80 years old, and Miss Potter, 74. These had been
its permanent occupants for many years. Minott had
been on his last legs for some time,&mdash;at last off his
legs, expecting weekly to take his departure,&mdash;a burden
to himself and friends,&mdash;yet dry and natural as
ever. His sister took care of him, and supported herself
and family with her needle, as usual. He lately
willed his little property to her, as a slight compensation
for her care. Feb. 13 their sister, 86 or 87, who
lived across the way, died. Miss Minott had taken
cold in visiting her, and was so sick that she could not
go to her funeral. She herself died of lung fever<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
 on
the 18th (which was said to be the same disease that
her sister had),&mdash;having just willed her property back
to George, and added her own mite to it. Miss Potter,
too, had now become ill,&mdash;too ill to attend the funeral,&mdash;and
she died of the same disease on the 23d. All
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
departed as gently as the sun goes down, leaving
George alone.</p>

<p>I called to see him the other day,&mdash;the 27th of February,
a remarkably pleasant spring day,&mdash;and as I
was climbing the sunny slope to his strangely deserted
house, I heard the first bluebirds upon the elm that
hangs over it. They had come as usual, though some
who used to hear them were gone. Even Minott had
not heard them, though the door was open,&mdash;for he
was thinking of other things. Perhaps there will be a
time when the bluebirds themselves will not return any
more.</p>

<p>I hear that George, a few days after this, called out
to his niece, who had come to take care of him, and
was in the next room, to know if she did not feel
lonely? "Yes, I do," said she. "So do I," added he.
He said he was like an old oak, all shattered and decaying.
"I am sure, Uncle," said his niece, "you are
not much like an oak!" "I mean," said he, "that I
am like an oak or any other tree, inasmuch as I cannot
stir from where I am."</p>

<p class="p2">Either this topic was too pathetic for Thoreau to
finish the letter, or perchance he thought it not likely
to interest his friend; for he threw aside this draft for
three days, and then, with the same beginning, wrote
a very different letter. The Minotts were old familiar
acquaintance, and related to that Captain Minott whom
Thoreau's grandmother married as a second husband.
George was his "old man of Verona," who had not
left Concord for more than forty years, except to stray
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
over the town bounds in hunting or wood-ranging; and
Mary was the "tailoress" who for years made Thoreau's
garments.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO DANIEL RICKETSON (AT NEW BEDFORD).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, March 22, 1861.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Friend Ricketson</span>,&mdash;The bluebird was here the
26th of February, at least, which is one day earlier than
you date; but I have not heard of larks nor pigeon
woodpeckers. To tell the truth, I am not on the alert
for the signs of spring, not having had any winter yet.
I took a severe cold about the 3d of December, which
at length resulted in a kind of bronchitis, so that I have
been confined to the house ever since, excepting a very
few experimental trips as far as the post-office in some
particularly fine noons. My health otherwise has not
been affected in the least, nor my spirits. I have simply
been imprisoned for so long, and it has not prevented
my doing a good deal of reading and the like.</p>

<p>Channing has looked after me very faithfully; says
he has made a study of my case, and knows me better
than I know myself, etc., etc. Of course, if I knew how
it began, I should know better how it would end. I
trust that when warm weather comes I shall begin to
pick up my crumbs. I thank you for your invitation
to come to New Bedford, and will bear it in mind; but
at present my health will not permit my leaving home.</p>

<p>The day I received your letter, Blake and Brown
arrived here, having walked from Worcester in two
days, though Alcott, who happened in soon after, could
not understand what pleasure they found in walking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
across the country in this season, when the ways were
so unsettled. I had a solid talk with them for a day
and a half&mdash;though my pipes were not in good order&mdash;and
they went their way again.</p>

<p>You may be interested to hear that Alcott is at present,
perhaps, the most successful man in the town.
He had his second annual exhibition of all the schools
in the town, at the Town Hall last Saturday; at which
all the masters and misses did themselves great credit,
as I hear, and of course reflected some on their teachers
and parents. They were making their little speeches
from one till six o'clock <span class="smcap">P. M.</span>, to a large audience, which
patiently listened to the end. In the meanwhile, the
children made Mr. Alcott an unexpected present of a
fine edition of "Pilgrim's Progress" and Herbert's
Poems, which, of course, overcame all parties. I inclose
an order of exercises.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
</p>

<p>We had, last night, an old-fashioned northeast snow-storm,
far worse than anything in the winter; and the
drifts are now very high above the fences. The inhabitants
are pretty much confined to their houses, as I was
already. All houses are one color, white, with the snow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
plastered over them, and you cannot tell whether they
have blinds or not. Our pump has another pump, its
ghost, as thick as itself, sticking to one side of it. The
town has sent out teams of eight oxen each, to break
out the roads; and the train due from Boston at 8½
<span class="smcap">A. M.</span> has not arrived yet (4 <span class="smcap">P. M.</span>). All the passing has
been a train from above at 12 <span class="smcap">M.</span>, which also was due
at 8½ <span class="smcap">A. M.</span> Where are the bluebirds now, think you?
I suppose that you have not so much snow at New Bedford,

<p class="center p2">TO PARKER PILLSBURY (AT CONCORD N. H.).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, April 10, 1861.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Friend Pillsbury</span>,&mdash;I am sorry to say that I have
not a copy of "Walden" which I can spare; and know
of none, unless possibly Ticknor &amp; Fields may have
one. I send, nevertheless, a copy of "The Week," the
price of which is one dollar and twenty-five cents,
which you can pay at your convenience.</p>

<p>As for your friend, my prospective reader, I hope he
ignores Fort Sumter, and "Old Abe," and all that; for
that is just the most fatal, and, indeed, the only fatal
weapon you can direct against evil, ever; for, as long
as you <i>know of it</i>, you are <i>particeps criminis</i>. What
business have you, if you are an "angel of light," to
be pondering over the deeds of darkness, reading the
<i>New York Herald</i>, and the like?</p>

<p>I do not so much regret the present condition of
things in this country (provided I regret it at all), as I
do that I ever heard of it. I know one or two, who
have this year, for the first time, read a President's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
Message; but they do not see that this implies a <i>fall</i> in
themselves, rather than a <i>rise</i> in the President. Blessed
were the days before you read a President's Message.
Blessed are the young, for they do not read the President's
Message. Blessed are they who never read a
newspaper, for they shall see Nature, and, through her,
God.</p>

<p>But, alas! <i>I</i> have heard of Sumter and Pickens, and
even of Buchanan (though I did not read his Message).
I also read the <i>New York Tribune</i>; but then, I am
reading Herodotus and Strabo, and Blodget's "Climatology,"
and "Six Years in the Desert of North
America," as hard as I can, to counterbalance it.</p>

<p>By the way, Alcott is at present our most popular
and successful man, and has just published a volume
in size, in the shape of the Annual School Report,
which I presume he has sent to you.</p>

<p>Yours, for remembering all good things,</p>

<p class="left65">
<span class="smcap">Henry D. Thoreau</span>.</p>

<p>Parker Pillsbury, to whom this letter went, was an
old friend of the Thoreau family, with whom he became
intimate in the antislavery agitation, wherein
they took part, while he was a famous orator, celebrated
by Emerson in one of his essays. Mr. Pillsbury
visited Thoreau in his last illness, when he could
scarcely speak above a whisper, and, having made to
him some remark concerning the future life, Thoreau
replied, "My friend, one world at a time." His petulant
words in this letter concerning national affairs
would hardly have been said a few days later, when,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
at the call of Abraham Lincoln, the people rose to protect
their government, and every President's Message
became of thrilling interest, even to Thoreau.</p>

<p>Arrangements were now making for the invalid,
about whose health his friends had been anxious for
some years, to travel for a better climate than the New
England spring affords, and early in May Thoreau set
out for the upper Mississippi. He thus missed the last
letter sent to him by his English friend Cholmondeley,
which I answered, then forwarded to him at Redwing,
in Minnesota. It is of interest enough to be given here.</p>

<p class="center p2">T. CHOLMONDELEY TO THOREAU (IN MINNESOTA).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Shrewsbury</span> [England], April 23, 1861.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Thoreau</span>,&mdash;It is now some time since I
wrote to you or heard from you, but do not suppose
that I have forgotten you, or shall ever cease to cherish
in my mind those days at dear old Concord. The last
I heard about you all was from Morton,<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
 who was in
England about a year ago; and I hope that he has
got over his difficulties and is now in his own country
again. I think he has seen rather more of English
country life than most Yankee tourists; and appeared
to find it <i>curious</i>, though I fear he was dulled by our
ways; for he was too full of ceremony and compliments
and bows, which is a mistake here; though very
well in Spain. I am afraid he was rather on pins and
needles; but he made a splendid speech at a volunteer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
supper, and indeed the <i>very best</i>, some said, ever heard
in this part of the country.</p>

<p>We are here in a state of alarm and apprehension,
the world being so troubled in East and West and everywhere.
Last year the harvest was bad and scanty.
This year our trade is beginning to feel the events in
America. In reply to the northern tariff, of course we
are going to smuggle as much as we can. The supply
of cotton being such a necessity to us, we must work
up India and South Africa a little better. There is war
even in old New Zealand, but not in the same island
where my people are! Besides, we are certainly on the
eve of a continental blaze, <i>so we are making merry and
living while we can</i>; not being sure where we shall be
this time a year.</p>

<p>Give my affectionate regards to your father, mother,
and sister, and to Mr. Emerson and his family, and
to Channing, Sanborn, Ricketson, Blake, and Morton
and Alcott and Parker. A thought arises in my mind
whether I may not be enumerating some dead men!
Perhaps Parker is!</p>

<p>These rumors of wars make me wish that we had
got done with this brutal stupidity of war altogether;
and I believe, Thoreau, that the human race will at
last get rid of it, though perhaps not in a creditable
way; but such <i>powers</i> will be brought to bear that it
will become monstrous even to the French. Dundonald
declared to the last that he possessed secrets which
from their tremendous character would make war impossible.
So peace may be begotten from the machinations
of evil.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span></p>

<p>Have you heard of any good books lately? I think
"Burnt Njal" good, and believe it to be genuine.
"Hast thou not heard" (says Steinrora to Thangbrand)
"how Thor challenged Christ to single combat, and
how he did not dare to fight with Thor?" When Gunnar
brandishes his sword, three swords are seen in air.
The account of Ospah and Brodir and Brian's battle
is the only historical account of that engagement, which
the Irish talk so much of; for I place little trust in
O'Halloran's authority, though the outline is the same
in both.</p>

<p>Darwin's "Origin of Species" may be fanciful, but
it is a move in the right direction. Emerson's "Conduct
of Life" has done me good; but it will not go
down in England for a generation or so. But <i>these</i> are
some of them already a year or two old. The book of
the season is Du Chaillu's "Central Africa," with accounts
of the Gorilla, of which you are aware that you
have had a skeleton at Boston for many years. There
is also one in the British Museum; but they have now
several stuffed specimens at the Geographical Society's
rooms in Town. I suppose you will have seen Sir Emerson
Tennent's "Ceylon," which is perhaps as complete
a book as ever was published; and a better monument
to a governor's residence in a great province was never
made.</p>

<p>We have been lately astonished by a foreign Hamlet,
a supposed impossibility; but Mr. Fechter does real
wonders. No doubt he will visit America, and then
you may see the best actor in the world. He has carried
out Goethe's idea of Hamlet as given in the "Wilhelm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>
Meister," showing him forth as a fair-haired and
fat man. I suppose you are not got fat yet?</p>

<p class="center p2">TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, May 3, 1861.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Blake</span>,&mdash;I am still as much an invalid as when
you and Brown were here, if not more of one, and at
this rate there is danger that the cold weather may
come again, before I get over my bronchitis. The doctor
accordingly tells me that I must "clear out" to the
West Indies, or elsewhere,&mdash;he does not seem to care
much where. But I decide against the West Indies, on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
account of their muggy heat in the summer, and the
South of Europe, on account of the expense of time and
money, and have at last concluded that it will be most
expedient for me to try the air of Minnesota, say somewhere
about St. Paul's. I am only waiting to be well
enough to start. Hope to get off within a week or ten
days.</p>

<p>The inland air may help me at once, or it may not.
At any rate, I am so much of an invalid that I shall
have to study my comfort in traveling to a remarkable
degree,&mdash;stopping to rest, etc., etc., if need be. I think
to get a through ticket to Chicago, with liberty to stop
frequently on the way, making my first stop of consequence
at Niagara Falls, several days or a week, at a
private boarding-house; then a night or day at Detroit;
and as much at Chicago as my health may require. At
Chicago I can decide at what point (Fulton, Dunleith,
or another) to strike the Mississippi, and take a boat
to St. Paul's.</p>

<p>I trust to find a private boarding-house in one or
various agreeable places in that region, and spend my
time there. I expect, and shall be prepared, to be gone
three months; and I would like to return by a different
route,&mdash;perhaps Mackinaw and Montreal.</p>

<p>I have thought of finding a companion, of course,
yet not seriously, because I had no right to offer myself
as a companion to anybody, having such a peculiarly
private and all-absorbing but miserable business
as <i>my</i> health, and not altogether <i>his</i>, to attend to,
causing me to stop here and go there, etc., etc., unaccountably.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, I have just now decided to let you
know of my intention, thinking it barely possible that
you might like to make a part or the whole of this
journey at the same time, and that perhaps your own
health may be such as to be benefited by it.</p>

<p>Pray let me know if such a statement offers any
temptations to you. I write in great haste for the mail,
and must omit all the moral.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO F. B. SANBORN (AT CONCORD).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Redwing, Minnesota</span>, June 26, 1861.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sanborn</span>,&mdash;I was very glad to find awaiting
me, on my arrival here on Sunday afternoon, a letter
from you. I have performed this journey in a very
dead and alive manner, but nothing has come so near
waking me up as the receipt of letters from Concord.
I read yours, and one from my sister (and Horace
Mann, his four), near the top of a remarkable isolated
bluff here, called Barn Bluff, or the Grange, or Redwing
Bluff, some four hundred and fifty feet high, and
half a mile long,&mdash;a bit of the main bluff or bank
standing alone. The top, as you know, rises to the
general level of the surrounding country, the river having
eaten out so much. Yet the valley just above and
below this (we are at the head of Lake Pepin) must be
three or four miles wide.</p>

<p>I am not even so well informed as to the progress of
the war as you suppose. I have seen but one Eastern
paper (that, by the way, <i>was</i> the <i>Tribune</i>) for five
weeks. I have not taken much pains to get them; but,
necessarily, I have not seen any paper at all for more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
than a week at a time. The people of Minnesota have
<i>seemed</i> to me more cold,&mdash;to feel less implicated in
this war than the people of Massachusetts. It is apparent
that Massachusetts, for one State at least, is
doing much more than her share in carrying it on.
However, I have dealt partly with those of Southern
birth, and have seen but little way beneath the surface.
I was glad to be told yesterday that there was a good
deal of weeping here at Redwing the other day, when
the volunteers stationed at Fort Snelling followed the
regulars to the seat of the war. They do not weep
when their children go <i>up</i> the river to occupy the deserted
forts, though they <i>may</i> have to fight the Indians
there.</p>

<p>I do not even know what the attitude of England is
at present.</p>

<p>The grand feature hereabouts is, of course, the Mississippi
River. Too much can hardly be said of its
grandeur, and of the beauty of this portion of it (from
Dunleith, and probably from Rock Island to this place).
St. Paul is a dozen miles below the Falls of St. Anthony,
or near the head of uninterrupted navigation on
the main stream, about two thousand miles from its
mouth. There is not a "rip" below that, and the river
is almost as wide in the upper as the lower part of its
course. Steamers go up the Sauk Rapids, above the
Falls, near a hundred miles farther, and then you are
fairly in the pine woods and lumbering country. Thus
it flows from the pine to the palm.</p>

<p>The lumber, as you know, is sawed chiefly at the
Falls of St. Anthony (what is not rafted in the log to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
ports far below), having given rise to the towns of St.
Anthony, Minneapolis, etc., etc. In coming up the
river from Dunleith, you meet with great rafts of sawed
lumber and of logs, twenty rods or more in length, by
five or six wide, floating down, all from the pine region
above the Falls. An old Maine lumberer, who has followed
the same business here, tells me that the sources
of the Mississippi were comparatively free from rocks
and rapids, making easy work for them; but he thought
that the timber was more knotty here than in Maine.</p>

<p>It has chanced that about half the men whom I have
spoken with in Minnesota, whether travelers or settlers,
were from Massachusetts.</p>

<p>After spending some three weeks in and about St.
Paul, St. Anthony, and Minneapolis, we made an excursion
in a steamer, some three hundred or more miles
up the Minnesota (St. Peter's) River, to Redwood, or
the Lower Sioux Agency, in order to see the plains, and
the Sioux, who were to receive their annual payment
there. This is eminently <i>the</i> river of Minnesota (for she
shares the Mississippi with Wisconsin), and it is of incalculable
value to her. It flows through a very fertile
country destined to be famous for its wheat; but it is
a remarkably winding stream, so that Redwood is only
half as far from its mouth by land as by water. There
was not a straight reach a mile in length as far as we
went,&mdash;generally you could not see a quarter of a mile
of water, and the boat was steadily turning this way or
that. At the greater bends, as the Traverse des Sioux,
some of the passengers were landed, and walked across
to be taken in on the other side. Two or three times
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
you could have thrown a stone across the neck of the
isthmus, while it was from one to three miles around
it. It was a very novel kind of navigation to me. The
boat was perhaps the largest that had been up so high,
and the water was rather low (it had been about fifteen
feet higher). In making a short turn, we repeatedly
and designedly ran square into the steep and soft bank,
taking in a cart-load of earth,&mdash;this being more effectual
than the rudder to fetch us about again; or the
deeper water was so narrow and close to the shore, that
we were obliged to run into and break down at least
fifty trees which overhung the water, when we did not
cut them off, repeatedly losing a part of our outworks,
though the most exposed had been taken in. I could
pluck almost any plant on the bank from the boat.
We very frequently got aground, and then drew ourselves
along with a windlass and a cable fastened to a
tree, or we swung round in the current, and completely
blocked up and blockaded the river, one end of the
boat resting on each shore. And yet we would haul
ourselves round again with the windlass and cable in
an hour or two, though the boat was about one hundred
and sixty feet long, and drew some three feet of
water, or, often, water and sand. It was one consolation
to know that in such a case we were all the while
damming the river, and so raising it. We once ran
fairly on to a concealed rock, with a shock that aroused
all the passengers, and rested there, and the mate went
below with a lamp, expecting to find a hole, but he
did not. Snags and sawyers were so common that I
forgot to mention them. The sound of the boat rumbling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
over one was the ordinary music. However, as
long as the boiler did not burst, we knew that no serious
accident was likely to happen. Yet this was a
singularly navigable river, more so than the Mississippi
above the Falls, and it is owing to its very crookedness.
Ditch it straight, and it would not only be
very swift, but soon run out. It was from ten to fifteen
rods wide near the mouth, and from eight to ten or
twelve at Redwood. Though the current was swift, I
did not see a "rip" on it, and only three or four rocks.
For three months in the year I am told that it can be
navigated by small steamers about twice as far as we
went, or to its source in Big Stone Lake; and a former
Indian agent told me that at high water it was thought
that such a steamer might pass into the Red River.</p>

<p>In short, this river proved so very <i>long</i> and navigable,
that I was reminded of the last letter or two in the voyage
of the Baron la Hontan (written near the end of
the seventeenth century, I <i>think</i>), in which he states,
that, after reaching the Mississippi (by the Illinois or
Wisconsin), the limit of previous exploration westward,
he voyaged up it with his Indians, and at length turned
up a great river coming in from the west, which he
called "La Rivière Longue;" and he relates various
improbable things about the country and its inhabitants,
so that this letter has been regarded as pure fiction, or,
more properly speaking, a lie. But I am somewhat inclined
now to reconsider the matter.</p>

<p>The Governor of Minnesota (Ramsay), the superintendent
of Indian affairs in this quarter, and the newly
appointed Indian agent were on board; also a German
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
band from St. Paul, a small cannon for salutes, and the
money for the Indians (ay, and the gamblers, it was
said, who were to bring it back in another boat). There
were about one hundred passengers, chiefly from St.
Paul, and more or less recently from the northeastern
States; also half a dozen young educated Englishmen.
Chancing to speak with one who sat next to me, when
the voyage was nearly half over, I found that he was
the son of the Rev. Samuel May,<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
 and a classmate of
yours, and had been looking for us at St. Anthony.</p>

<p>The last of the little settlements on the river was
New Ulm, about one hundred miles this side of Redwood.
It consists wholly of Germans. We left them
one hundred barrels of salt, which will be worth something
more when the water is lowest than at present.</p>

<p>Redwood is a mere locality,&mdash;scarcely an Indian
village,&mdash;where there is a store, and some houses have
been built for them. We were now fairly on the great
plains, and looking south; and, after walking that way
three miles, could see no tree in that horizon. The buffalo
were said to be feeding within twenty-five or thirty
miles.</p>

<p>A regular council was held with the Indians, who
had come in on their ponies, and speeches were made
on both sides through an interpreter, quite in the
described mode,&mdash;the Indians, as usual, having the
advantage in point of truth and earnestness, and therefore
of eloquence. The most prominent chief was named
Little Crow. They were quite dissatisfied with the white
man's treatment of them, and probably have reason to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
be so. This council was to be continued for two or three
days,&mdash;the payment to be made the second day; and
another payment to other bands a little higher up, on
the Yellow Medicine (a tributary of the Minnesota), a
few days thereafter.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, the half-naked Indians performed
a dance, at the request of the Governor, for our amusement
and their own benefit; and then we took leave of
them, and of the officials who had come to treat with
them.</p>

<p>Excuse these pencil marks, but my inkstand is <i>unscrewable</i>,
and I can only direct my letter at the bar.
I could tell you more, and perhaps more interesting
things, if I had time. I am considerably better than
when I left home, but still far from well.</p>

<p>Our faces are already set toward home. Will you
please let my sister know that we shall <i>probably</i> start
for Milwaukee and Mackinaw in a day or two (or as
soon as we hear from home) <i>via</i> Prairie du Chien, and
not La Crosse.</p>

<p>I am glad to hear that you have written Cholmondeley,<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>

as it relieves me of some <i>responsibility</i>.</p>

<p class="p2">The tour described in this long letter was the first
and last that Thoreau ever made west of the Mohawk
Valley, though his friend Channing had early visited
the great prairies, and lived in log cabins of Illinois,
or sailed on the chain of great lakes, by which Thoreau
made a part of this journey. It was proposed that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
Channing should accompany him this time, as he had
in the tour through Lower Canada, and along Cape
Cod, as well as in the journeys through the Berkshire
and Catskill mountains, and down the Hudson; but
some misunderstanding or temporary inconvenience
prevented. The actual comrade was young Horace
Mann, eldest son of the school-reformer and statesman
of that name,&mdash;a silent, earnest, devoted naturalist,
who died early. The place where his party met the
Indians&mdash;only a few months before the Minnesota
massacre of 1862&mdash;was in the county of Redwood, in
the southwest of the State, where now is a thriving village
of 1500 people, and no buffaloes within five hundred
miles. Red Wing, whence the letter was written,
is below St. Paul, on the Mississippi, and was even then
a considerable town,&mdash;now a city of 7000 people.
The Civil War had lately begun, and the whole North
was in the first flush of its uprising in defense of the
Union,&mdash;for which Thoreau, in spite of his earlier
defiance of government (for its alliance with slavery),
was as zealous as any soldier. He returned in July,
little benefited by the journey, of which he did not take
his usual sufficiency of notes, and to which there is
little allusion in his books. Nor does it seem that he
visited on the way his correspondent since January,
1856,&mdash;C. H. Greene, of Rochester, Michigan, who
had never seen him in Concord. The opinion of
Thoreau himself concerning this journey will be found
in his next letter to Daniel Ricketson.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">TO DANIEL RICKETSON (AT NEW BEDFORD).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, August 15, 1861.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Friend Ricketson</span>,&mdash;When your last letter was
written I was away in the far Northwest, in search of
health. My cold turned to bronchitis, which made me
a close prisoner almost up to the moment of my starting
on that journey, early in May. As I had an incessant
cough, my doctor told me that I must "clear out,"&mdash;to
the West Indies, or elsewhere,&mdash;so I selected Minnesota.
I returned a few weeks ago, after a good deal of steady
traveling, considerably, yet not essentially, better; my
cough still continuing. If I don't mend very quickly, I
shall be obliged to go to another climate again very soon.</p>

<p>My ordinary pursuits, both indoors and out, have
been for the most part omitted, or seriously interrupted,&mdash;walking,
boating, scribbling, etc. Indeed, I
have been sick so long that I have almost forgotten
what it is to be well; and yet I feel that it is in all
respects only my envelope. Channing and Emerson
are as well as usual; but Alcott, I am sorry to say, has
for some time been more or less confined by a lameness,
perhaps of a neuralgic character, occasioned by carrying
too great a weight on his back while gardening.</p>

<p>On returning home, I found various letters awaiting
me; among others, one from Cholmondeley, and one
from yourself.</p>

<p>Of course I am sufficiently surprised to hear of your
conversion;<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
 yet I scarcely know what to say about it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
unless that, judging by your account, it appears to me
a change which concerns yourself peculiarly, and will
not make you more valuable to mankind. However,
perhaps I must see you before I can judge.</p>

<p>Remembering your numerous invitations, I write this
short note now, chiefly to say that, if you are to be at
home, and it will be quite agreeable to you, I will pay
you a visit next week, and take such rides or sauntering
walks with you as an invalid may.</p>

<p class="p2">The visit was made, and we owe to it the preservation
of the latest portraiture of Thoreau, who, at his
friend's urgency, sat to a photographer in New Bedford;
and thus we have the full-bearded likeness of
August, 1861; from which, also, and from personal
recollection, Mr. Walton Ricketson made the fine profile
medallion reproduced in photogravure for this
volume.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO DANIEL RICKETSON (AT NEW BEDFORD).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, October 14, 1861.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Friend Ricketson</span>,&mdash;I think that, on the whole,
my health is better than when you were here; but my
faith in the doctors has not increased. I thank you all
for your invitation to come to New Bedford, but I suspect
that it must still be warmer here than there; that,
indeed, New Bedford is warmer than Concord only in
the winter, and so I abide by Concord.</p>

<p>September was pleasanter and much better for me
than August, and October has thus far been quite tolerable.
Instead of riding on horseback, I ride in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
wagon about every other day. My neighbor, Mr. E. R.
Hoar, has two horses, and he, being away for the most
part this fall, has generously offered me the use of one
of them; and, as I notice, the dog throws himself in,
and does scouting duty.</p>

<p>I am glad to hear that you no longer chew, but eschew,
sugar-plums. One of the worst effects of sickness
is, that it may get one into the <i>habit</i> of taking a
little something&mdash;his bitters, or sweets, as if for his
bodily good&mdash;from time to time, when he does not
need it. However, there is no danger of this if you do
not dose even when you are sick.</p>

<p>I went with a Mr. Rodman, a young man of your
town, here the other day, or week, looking at farms for
sale, and rumor says that he is inclined to buy a particular
one. Channing says that he received his book,
but has not got any of yours.</p>

<p>It is easy to talk, but hard to write.</p>

<p>From the worst of all correspondents,</p>

<p class="left65">
<span class="smcap">Henry D. Thoreau</span>.</p>

<p>No later letter than this was written by Thoreau's
own hand; for he was occupied all the winter of 1861-62,
when he could write, in preparing his manuscripts
for the press. Nothing appeared before his death, but
in June, 1862, Mr. Fields, then editing the <i>Atlantic</i>,
printed "Walking,"&mdash;the first of three essays which
came out in that magazine the same year. Nothing of
Thoreau's had been accepted for the <i>Atlantic</i> since 1858,
when he withdrew the rest of "Chesuncook," then coming
out in its pages, because the editor (Mr. Lowell) had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
made alterations in the manuscript. In April, just before
his death, the <i>Atlantic</i> printed a short and characteristic
sketch of Thoreau by Bronson Alcott, and in
August, Emerson's funeral oration, given in the parish
church of Concord. During the last six months of his
illness, his sister and his friends wrote letters for him,
as will be seen by the two that follow.</p>

<p class="center p2">SOPHIA THOREAU TO DANIEL RICKETSON (AT NEW
BEDFORD).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, December 19, 1861.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Ricketson</span>:
</p>

<p><i>Dear Sir</i>,&mdash;Thank you for your friendly interest in
my dear brother. I wish that I could report more favorably
in regard to his health. Soon after your visit to
Concord, Henry commenced riding, and almost every
day he introduced me to some of his familiar haunts,
far away in the thick woods, or by the ponds; all very
new and delightful to me. The air and exercise which
he enjoyed during the fine autumn days were a benefit
to him; he seemed stronger, had a good appetite, and
was able to attend somewhat to his writing; but since
the cold weather has come, his cough has increased,
and he is able to go out but seldom. Just now he is
suffering from an attack of pleurisy, which confines him
wholly to the house. His spirits do not fail him; he
continues in his usual serene mood, which is very pleasant
for his friends as well as himself. I am hoping for
a short winter and early spring, that the invalid may
again be out of doors.</p>

<p>I am sorry to hear of your indisposition, and trust
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
that you will be well again soon. It would give me
pleasure to see some of your newspaper articles, since
you possess a hopeful spirit. My patience is nearly exhausted.
The times look <i>very</i> dark. I think the next
soldier who is shot for sleeping on his post should be
Gen. McClellan. Why does he not do something in
the way of fighting? I despair of ever living under the
reign of Sumner or Phillips.</p>

<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, January 10, 1862.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;You have not been informed of
Henry's condition this winter, and will be sorry to hear
that he grows feebler day by day, and is evidently failing
and fading from our sight. He gets some sleep,
has a pretty good appetite, reads at intervals, takes
notes of his readings, and likes to see his friends, conversing,
however, with difficulty, as his voice partakes
of his general debility. We had thought this oldest inhabitant
of our Planet would have chosen to stay and
see it fairly dismissed into the Chaos (out of which he
has brought such precious jewels,&mdash;gifts to friends, to
mankind generally, diadems for fame to coming followers,
forgetful of his own claims to the honors) before
he chose simply to withdraw from the spaces and times
he has adorned with the truth of his genius. But the
masterly work is nearly done for us here. And our
woods and fields are sorrowing, though not in sombre,
but in robes of white, so becoming to the piety and
probity they have known so long, and soon are to miss.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
There has been none such since Pliny, and it will be
long before there comes his like; the most sagacious
and wonderful Worthy of his time, and a marvel to
coming ones.</p>

<p>I write at the suggestion of his sister, who thought
his friends would like to be informed of his condition
to the latest date.</p>

<p>Ever yours and respectfully,</p>

<p class="left65">
<span class="smcap">A. Bronson Alcott</span>.</p>

<p>The last letter of Henry Thoreau, written by the
hand of his sister, was sent to Myron Benton, a young
literary man then living in Dutchess County, New York,
who had written a grateful letter to the author of
"Walden" (January 6, 1862), though quite unacquainted
with him. Mr. Benton said that the news of
Thoreau's illness had affected him as if it were that
"of a personal friend whom I had known a long time,"
and added: "The secret of the influence by which
your writings charm me is altogether as intangible,
though real, as the attraction of Nature herself. I read
and reread your books with ever fresh delight. Nor is
it pleasure alone; there is a singular spiritual healthiness
with which they seem imbued,&mdash;the expression of
a soul essentially sound, so free from any morbid tendency."
After mentioning that his own home was in a
pleasant valley, once the hunting-ground of the Indians,
Mr. Benton said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I was in hope to read something more from your
pen in Mr. Conway's <i>Dial</i>,<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
 but only recognized that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
fine pair of Walden twinlets. Of your two books, I
perhaps prefer the 'Week'&mdash;but after all, 'Walden'
is but little less a favorite. In the former, I like especially
those little snatches of poetry interspersed
throughout. I would like to ask what progress you
have made in a work some way connected with natural
history,&mdash;I think it was on Botany,&mdash;which Mr.
Emerson told me something about in a short interview
I had with him two years ago at Poughkeepsie....
If you should feel perfectly able at any time to
drop me a few lines, I would like much to know what
your state of health is, and if there is, as I cannot but
hope, a prospect of your speedy recovery."</p>

<p>Two months and more passed before Thoreau replied;
but his habit of performing every duty, whether
of business or courtesy, would not excuse him from an
answer, which was this:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center p2">TO MYRON B. BENTON (AT LEEDSVILLE, N. Y.).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, March 21, 1862.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I thank you for your very kind letter,
which, ever since I received it, I have intended to answer
before I died, however briefly. I am encouraged
to know, that, so far as you are concerned, I have not
written my books in vain. I was particularly gratified,
some years ago, when one of my friends and neighbors
said, "I wish you would write another book,&mdash;write
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
it for me." He is actually more familiar with what I
have written than I am myself.</p>

<p>The verses you refer to in Conway's <i>Dial</i> were written
by F. B. Sanborn of this town. I never wrote for
that journal.</p>

<p>I am pleased when you say that in the "Week" you
like especially "those little snatches of poetry interspersed
through the book," for these, I suppose, are
the least attractive to most readers. I have not been
engaged in any particular work on Botany, or the like,
though, if I were to live, I should have much to report
on Natural History generally.</p>

<p>You ask particularly after my health. I <i>suppose</i> that
I have not many months to live; but, of course, I know
nothing about it. I may add that I am enjoying existence
as much as ever, and regret nothing.</p>

<p>He died May 6, 1862; his mother died March 12,

<p class="p2">The letters of Thoreau, early or late, which did not reach
me in time to be used in the original edition of this book, and
have since appeared in print here and there, are included
either in order of their date in the preceding pages (in the
case of the additional Ricketson letters) or in this Appendix.
I owe the right to use the following correspondence to Mr.
E. H. Russell of Worcester and to Dr. S. A. Jones of Ann
Arbor, Michigan, who first obtained from the family of Calvin
H. Greene of Rochester, Michigan, the Greene letters, five
in number, all short, but characteristic. Dr. Jones printed
these in a small edition at Jamaica, N. Y., and along with them
some letters of Miss Sophia Thoreau to Mr. Greene, and portions
of Greene's Diary during his two visits to Concord in
September, 1863, and August, 1874. In these papers he left
initials, or letters commonly used for unknown quantities,
to stand for certain names occurring there. "X." and "X. Y.
Z." in this Diary, and in Miss Thoreau's letters, signify Ellery
Channing, to whom in March, 1863, Mr. Greene had sent the
manzanita cane, headed with buffalo-horn and tipped with
silver, which he had made with his own hands and intended
for Thoreau, and which Mr. Channing gave to me, as the
mutual friend of the two Concord poets. In the Diary I am
"Mr. S." This Diary and the letters of Miss Thoreau supply
some useful facts for a Thoreau biography, which this collection
of Familiar Letters was meant to be,&mdash;a biography
largely in the words of its subject. Notice is taken of such
facts in footnotes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span></p>

<p>The earlier letters to Isaac Hecker, afterwards known as
Father Hecker of New York, grew out of an acquaintance
formed with him while he was living at Mrs. Thoreau's, and
taking lessons of the late George Bradford, brother of Mrs.
Ripley. They were subsequent to Hecker's brief stay at Brook
Farm and Fruitlands, and when he was studying to be a
Catholic priest. He cherished the vain hope of converting
Thoreau to his own newly acquired faith, amid the influences
of Catholic Europe. The brief correspondence is printed in
the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> for September, 1902.</p>

<p>Isaac Hecker, born in December, 1819, two and a half
years after Thoreau, was the son of a German baker in New
York city, and of little education until he came to Massachusetts
at the age of twenty-three, as the disciple and friend of
Dr. Brownson, then a Protestant preacher and social democrat.
In January, 1843, he entered the Brook Farm community, not
as a member, but as a worker and student, making the bread
for the family and taking lessons of George Ripley, George
Bradford, Charles Dana, and John S. Dwight,&mdash;all friends
of the Concord circle of authors. But he was restless, and
yearned for a more ascetic life, and before he had been at
Brook Farm a month he was writing to Bronson Alcott about
entering the as yet unopened Fruitlands convent, between
which and Brook Farm Concord was a half-way station,
both physically and spiritually. Hecker tried all three; was
at Brook Farm, off and on, for six months, at Fruitlands
two weeks (from July 11 to July 25, 1843), and at Concord
two months (from April 22 to June 20, 1844). Then, August 1,
he was baptized in the Catholic faith at New York. The day
before this final step, towards which he had been tending for
a year, he wrote to Thoreau, proposing a journey through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
Europe on foot and without money. During his brief Concord
life he had been a lodger at the house of John Thoreau
(the Parkman house, where now the Public Library stands),
and had seen Henry Thoreau daily. Hecker thus describes his
room, his rent, and his landlady, who was Thoreau's mother:</p>

<p>"All that is needed for my comfort is here,&mdash;a room of good
size, very good people, furnished and to be kept in order
for 75 cents a week, including lights,&mdash;wood is extra pay;
a good straw bed, a large table, carpet, wash-stand, bookcase,
stove, chairs, looking-glass,&mdash;all, all that is needful.
The lady of the house, Mrs. Thoreau, is a <i>woman</i>. The only
fear I have about her is that she is too much like dear mother,&mdash;she
will take too much care of me. If you were to see her,
Mother, you would be perfectly satisfied that I have fallen into
good hands, and met a second mother, if that is possible.
I have just finished my dinner,&mdash;unleavened bread from
home, maple-sugar, and apples which I purchased this morning.
Previous to taking dinner I said my first lesson to Mr.
Bradford in Greek and Latin."</p>

<p>Hecker "boarded himself," but no doubt often partook
of Mrs. Thoreau's hospitality, and took long walks with Thoreau.
Writing to him three months after the first meeting
at Concord, Hecker said: "I have formed a certain project
which your influence has no slight share in forming. It is,
to work our passage to Europe, and to walk, work, and beg,
if need be, as far, when there, as we are inclined to do."</p>

<p class="center p2">TO ISAAC HECKER (AT NEW YORK).</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Concord</span>, August 14, 1844.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Friend Hecker</span>,&mdash;I am glad to hear your voice from
that populous city, and the more so for the tenor of its discourse.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
I have but just returned from a pedestrian excursion
somewhat similar to that you propose, <i>parvis componere magna</i>,
to the Catskill Mountains, over the principal mountains of
this State, subsisting mainly on bread and berries, and slumbering
on the mountain-tops. As usually happens, I now feel
a slight sense of dissipation. Still, I am strongly tempted by
your proposal, and experience a decided schism between my
outward and inward tendencies. Your method of traveling,
especially,&mdash;to live along the road, citizens of the world,
without haste or petty plans,&mdash;I have often proposed this to
my dreams, and still do. But the fact is, I cannot so decidedly
postpone exploring the <i>Farther Indies</i>, which are to be reached,
you know, by other routes and other methods of travel. I
mean that I constantly return from every external enterprise
with disgust, to fresh faith in a kind of Brahminical, Artesian,
Inner Temple life. All my experience, as yours probably,
proves only this reality. Channing wonders how I can resist
your invitation, I, a single man&mdash;unfettered&mdash;and so do I.
Why, there are Roncesvalles, the Cape de Finisterre, and the
Three Kings of Cologne; Rome, Athens, and the rest, to be
visited in serene, untemporal hours, and all history to revive
in one's memory, as he went by the way, with splendors too
bright for this world,&mdash;I know how it is. But is not here, too,
Roncesvalles with greater lustre? Unfortunately, it may prove
dull and desultory weather enough here, but better trivial
days with faith than the fairest ones lighted by sunshine alone.
Perchance, my <i>Wanderjahr</i> has not arrived, but you cannot
wait for that. I hope you will find a companion who will
enter as heartily into your schemes as I should have done.</p>

<p>I remember you, as it were, with the whole Catholic Church
at your skirts. And the other day, for a moment, I think I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
understood your relation to that body; but the thought was
gone again in a twinkling, as when a dry leaf falls from its
stem over our heads, but is instantly lost in the rustling mass
at our feet.</p>

<p>I am really sorry that the Genius will not let me go with
you, but I trust that it will conduct to other adventures, and
so, if nothing prevents, we will compare notes at last.</p>

<p class="p2">When this invitation reached Concord, Thoreau was absent
on a tour with Channing to the Berkshire Mountains
and the Catskills,&mdash;Channing coming up the Hudson from
New York (where he then lived, aiding Horace Greeley in
the <i>Tribune</i> office), and meeting his friend at the foot of the
Hoosac Mountain. On its summit Thoreau had spent the
night, sleeping under a board near the observatory tower
built by the Williams College students, as related by him in
the <i>Week</i>. They then crossed the Hudson and journeyed on
to the Catskills, returning together to Concord.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
 Meantime
Hecker had got impatient, and wrote again, to which Thoreau
replied, August 17, thus briefly:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center p2">TO ISAAC HECKER (AT NEW YORK).</p>

<p>I improve the occasion of my mother's sending to acknowledge
the receipt of your stirring letter. You have probably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
received mine by this time. I thank you for not anticipating
any vulgar objections on my part. <i>Far</i> travel, very <i>far</i> travel,
or travail, comes near to the worth of staying at home. Who
knows whence his education is to come! Perhaps I may drag
my anchor at length, or rather, when the <i>winds</i> which blow
<i>over</i> the deep fill my sails, may stand away for distant parts,&mdash;for
now I seem to have a firm <i>ground</i> anchorage, though
the harbor is low-shored enough, and the traffic with the natives
inconsiderable. I may be away to Singapore by the
next tide.</p>

<p>I like well the ring of your last maxim, "It is only the fear
of death makes us reason of impossibilities." And but for
fear, death itself is an impossibility.</p>

<p>Believe me, I can hardly let it end so. If you do not go soon,
let me hear from you again.</p>

<p>Hecker did not in fact go to Europe till a year later, and
when he walked over a part of central Europe, it was in company
with one or two young Catholic priests,&mdash;men very
unlike Thoreau.</p>

<p>The short correspondence with Calvin Greene (longer than
that with Hecker) occurred at intervals, a dozen years and
more after the Fruitlands period, when the Walden experience
had been lived through and recorded, and the friendship
with the Ricketson family was in its earlier stages. Mr. Greene,
when he called on me at his first visit to the Thoreau family
in 1863, mentioned that he had just read Thoreau's poem,
"The Departure," which at Sophia's request I had lately
printed in the Boston <i>Commonwealth</i>, a weekly that I had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
been editing since Moncure Conway had left Concord for
London, in the winter of 1862-63. Greene was a plain,
sincere man, never in New England before, who amused
Channing by saying he had "taken a boat-ride on the Atlantic."
He came once more in 1874, and spent an evening
with me in the house where Thoreau lived and died,&mdash;Mrs.
Thoreau then being dead, and Sophia at Bangor, where she
died in 1876.</p>

<p>The "Week" had so poor a publisher that it is quite uncertain

<p>As for the "more" that is to come, I cannot speak definitely

I should consider it a greater success to interest one

<p>You may rely on it that you have the best of me in my

near going West a-lecturing, and perhaps some winter may
bring me into your neighborhood, in which case I should

foreign and irksome to me, that I think I could only use it
to acquire the means with which to make an independent

<p>As for my pen, I can say that it is not altogether idle, though

to hear of the interest you take in my books; it is additional

 These, written to Thomas Cholmondeley, are still (1906) lacking;
but a few other letters have been published since 1894.</p>

 He was named David for this uncle; Dr. Ripley was the minister
of the whole town in 1817. The Red House stood near the Emerson
house on the Lexington road; the Woodwards were a wealthy family,
afterwards in Quincy, to which town Dr. Woodward left a large
bequest.</p>

 John Thoreau, grandfather of Henry, born at St. Helier's, Jersey,
April, 1754, was a sailor on board the American privateer General
Lincoln, November, 1779, and recognized La Sensible, French frigate,
which carried John Adams from Boston to France. See <i>Journal</i>,
vol. v, June 11, 1853. This John Thoreau, son of Philip, died in
Concord, 1800.</p>

 This had been the abode of old Deacon Parkman, a granduncle of
the late Francis Parkman, the historian, and son of the Westborough
clergyman from whom this distinguished family descends. Deacon
Parkman was a merchant in Concord, and lived in what was then a
good house. It stood in the middle of the village, where the Public
Library now is. The "Texas" house was built by Henry Thoreau
and his father John; it was named from a section of the village then
called "Texas," because a little remote from the churches and schools;
perhaps the same odd fancy that had bestowed the name of "Virginia"
on the road of Thoreau's birthplace. The "Yellow House reformed"
was a small cottage rebuilt and enlarged by the Thoreaus in 1850;
in this, on the main street, Henry and his father and mother died.</p>

 During the greater part of his college course he signed himself
D. H. Thoreau, as he was christened (David Henry); but being constantly
called "Henry," he put this name first about the time he left
college, and was seldom afterwards known by the former initials.</p>

 The impression made on one classmate and former room-mate
("chum") of Thoreau, by this utterance, will be seen by this fragment
of a letter from James Richardson of Dedham (afterwards Reverend
J. Richardson), dated Dedham, September 7, 1837:&mdash;</p>

<p class="footnote">
"<span class="smcap">Friend Thoreau</span>,&mdash;After you had finished your part in the
Performances of Commencement (the tone and sentiment of which,
by the way, I liked much, as being of a sound philosophy), I hardly
saw you again at all. Neither at Mr. Quincy's levee, neither at any
of our classmates' evening entertainments, did I find you; though for
the purpose of taking a farewell, and leaving you some memento of an
old chum, as well as on matters of business, I much wished to see your
face once more. Of course you must be present at our October meeting,&mdash;notice
of the time and place for which will be given in the
newspapers. I hear that you are comfortably located, in your native
town, as the guardian of its children, in the immediate vicinity, I suppose,
of one of our most distinguished apostles of the future, R. W.
Emerson, and situated under the ministry of our old friend Reverend
Barzillai Frost, to whom please make my remembrances. I heard
from you, also, that Concord Academy, lately under the care of Mr.
Phineas Allen of Northfield, is now vacant of a preceptor; should
Mr. Hoar find it difficult to get a scholar college-distinguished, perhaps
he would take up with one, who, though in many respects a
critical thinker, and a careful philosopher of language among other
things, has never distinguished himself in his class as a regular attendant
on college studies and rules. If so, could you do me the kindness
to mention my name to him as of one intending to make teaching his
profession, at least for a part of his life. If recommendations are
necessary, President Quincy has offered me one, and I can easily get
others."</p>

 This eldest of the children of John Thoreau and Cynthia Dunbar
was born October 22, 1812, and died June 14, 1849. Her grandmother,
Mary Jones of Weston, Mass., belonged to a Tory family, and several
of the Jones brothers served as officers in the British army against
General Washington.</p>

 White Pond, in the district called "Nine-Acre Corner," is here
meant; the "Lee-vites" were a family then living on Lee's Hill.
Naushawtuck is another name for this hill, where the old Tahatawan
lived at times, before the English settled in Concord in September,
1635. The real date of this letter is November 11-14, 1837, and between
its two dates the Massachusetts State election was held. The
"great council-house" was the Boston State-House, to which the
Concord people were electing deputies; the "Eagle-Beak" named
on the next page was doubtless Samuel Hoar, the first citizen of the
town, and for a time Member of Congress from Middlesex County.
He was the father of Rockwood and Frisbie Hoar, afterwards judge
and senator respectively.</p>

 A delicate sarcasm on young B., who could not finish his speech
in town-meeting without looking at his notes. The allusion to the
"Medicine whose words are like the music of the mockingbird" is
hard to explain; it may mean Edward Everett, then Governor of
Massachusetts, or, possibly, Emerson, whose lectures began to attract
notice in Boston and Cambridge. It can hardly mean Wendell Phillips,
though his melodious eloquence had lately been heard in attacks upon
slavery.</p>

 <i>Americana</i>, in this note, is the old <i>Encyclopedia Americana</i>, which
had been edited from the German <i>Conversations-Lexicon</i>, and other
sources, by Dr. Francis Lieber, T. G. Bradford, and other Boston
scholars, ten years earlier, and was the only convenient book of reference
at Thoreau's hand. The inquiry of John Thoreau is another
evidence of the interest he took, like his brother, in the Indians and
their flint arrowheads. The relics mentioned in the next letter were
doubtless Indian weapons and utensils, very common about Taunton
in the region formerly controlled by King Philip.</p>

 Dr. Edward Jarvis, born in Concord (1803), had gone to Louisville,
Ky., in April, 1837, and was thriving there as a physician. He
knew the Thoreaus well, and gave them good hopes of success in Ohio
or Kentucky as teachers. The plan was soon abandoned, and Henry
went to Maine to find a school, but without success. See Sanborn's

 Mrs. Brown, to whom this letter and several others of the years
1841-43 were written, lived by turns in Plymouth, her native place,
and in Concord, where she often visited Mrs. Emerson at the time
when Thoreau was an inmate of the Emerson household. In the early
part of 1843 she was in Plymouth, and her sister was sending her
newspapers and other things, from time to time. The incident of the
music-box, mentioned above, occurred at the Old Manse, where
Hawthorne was living from the summer of 1842 until the spring of
1845, and was often visited by Thoreau and Ellery Channing. In the
letter following, this incident is recalled, and with it the agreeable
gift by Richard Fuller (a younger brother of Margaret Fuller and of
Ellen, the wife of Ellery Channing, who came to reside in Concord
about these years, and soon became Thoreau's most intimate friend),
which was a music-box for the Thoreaus. They were all fond of music,
and enjoyed it even in this mechanical form,&mdash;one evidence of the
simple conditions of life in Concord then. The note of thanks to young
Fuller, who had been, perhaps, a pupil of Thoreau, follows this letter
to Mrs. Brown, though earlier in date. Mary Russell afterwards
became Mrs. Marston Watson.</p>

 An interesting fact in connection with Thoreau and Wheeler
(whose home was in Lincoln, four miles southeast of Concord) is
related by Ellery Channing in a note to me. It seems that Wheeler
had built for himself, or hired from a farmer, a rough woodland study
near Flint's Pond, half-way from Lincoln to Concord, which he
occupied for a short time in 1841-42, and where Thoreau and Channing
visited him. Mr. Channing wrote me in 1883: "Stearns Wheeler
built a 'shanty' on Flint's Pond for the purpose of economy, for purchasing
Greek books and going abroad to study. Whether Mr. Thoreau
assisted him to build this shanty I cannot say, but I think he may
have; also that he spent six weeks with him there. As Mr. Thoreau was
not too original and inventive to follow the example of others, if good
to him, it is very probable this undertaking of Stearns Wheeler, whom
he regarded (as I think I have heard him say) a heroic character, suggested
his own experiment on Walden. I believe I visited this shanty
with Mr. Thoreau. It was very plain, with bunks of straw, and built in
the Irish manner. I think Mr. Wheeler was as good a mechanic as
Mr. Thoreau, and built this shanty for his own use. The object of
these two experiments was quite unlike, except in the common purpose
of economy. It seems to me highly probable that Mr. Wheeler's experiment
suggested Mr. Thoreau's, as he was a man he almost worshiped.
But I could not understand what relation Mr. Lowell had to this fact,
if it be one. Students, in all parts of the earth, have pursued a similar
course from motives of economy, and to carry out some special study.
Mr. Thoreau wished to study birds, flowers, and the stone age, just as
Mr. Wheeler wished to study Greek. And Mr. Hotham came next
from just the same motive of economy (necessity) and to study the
Bible. The prudential sides of all three were the same." Mr. Hotham
was the young theological student who dwelt in a cabin by Walden
in 1869-70.</p>

published in it, with promise of payment, Thoreau's "Walk to Wachusett."
But much time had passed, and the debt was not paid; hence
the lack of a "shower of shillings" which the letter laments. Emerson's
reply gives the first news of the actual beginning of Alcott's short-lived
paradise at Fruitlands, and dwells with interest on the affairs of
the rural and lettered circle at Concord.</p>

any part of their debt on account of the <i>Boston Miscellany</i>. After
much talking, all the promise he could offer was 'that within a year it
would probably be paid,'&mdash;a probability which certainly looks very

should take your payment in the form of <i>Boston Miscellanies</i>! I shall
not fail to refresh their memory at intervals."</p>

 A lady who made such a night voyage with Thoreau, years before,
says: "How wise he was to ask the elderly lady with a younger one
for a row on the Concord River one moonlit night! The river that
night was as deep as the heavens above; serene stars shone from its
depths, as far off as the stars above. Deep answered unto deep in our
souls, as the boat glided swiftly along, past low-lying fields, under
overhanging trees. A neighbor's cow waded into the cool water,&mdash;she
became at once a Behemoth, a river-horse, hippopotamus, or river-god.
A dog barked,&mdash;he was Diana's hound, he waked Endymion.
Suddenly we were landed on a little isle; our boatman, our boat
glided far off in the flood. We were left alone, in the power of the
river-god; like two white birds we stood on this bit of ground, the
river flowing about us; only the eternal powers of nature around us.
Time for a prayer, perchance,&mdash;and back came the boat and oarsman;
we were ferried to our homes,&mdash;no question asked or answered.
We had drank of the cup of the night,&mdash;had left the silence and the
stars."</p>

 See Memoir of Bronson Alcott, pp. 485-494. The remark of
Emerson quoted on p. 486, that Cholmondeley was "the son of a
Shropshire squire," was not strictly correct, his father being a Cheshire
clergyman of a younger branch of the ancient race of Cholmondeley.
But he was the <i>grandson</i> of a Shropshire squire (owner of land), for
his mother was daughter and sister of such gentlemen, and it was
her brother Richard who presented Reginald Heber and Charles
Cholmondeley to the living of Hodnet, near Market Drayton.</p>

 Mr. Ricketson's immediate reply was received by Thoreau before
he wrote to Blake on the 22d. He set out from Concord for
Cambridge on Christmas Day, and reached Brooklawn, the country-house
of his friend, towards evening of that short day, on foot, with
his umbrella and traveling-bag, and he made so striking a figure in
the eyes of Ricketson that he sketched it roughly in his shanty-book.
His children have engraved it in their pleasing volume <i>Daniel Ricketson
and his Friends</i>, from the pages of which several of these letters
are taken. It is by no means a bad likeness of the plain and upright
Thoreau.</p>

which soon passed to the ownership of the Hunts; and this house

 These books were ordered by Cholmondeley in London, and sent
to Boston just as he was starting for the Crimean War, in October,
1855, calling them "a nest of Indian books." They included Mill's
<i>History of British India</i>, several translations of the sacred books of
India, and one of them in Sanscrit; the works of Bunsen, so far as
then published, and other valuable books. In the note accompanying
this gift, Cholmondeley said, "I think I never found so much kindness
in all my travels as in your country of New England." In return,
Thoreau sent his English friend, in 1857, his own <i>Week</i>, Emerson's
Poems, Walt Whitman's <i>Leaves of Grass</i>, and F. L. Olmsted's book
on the Southern States (then preparing for the secession which they
attempted four years later). This was perhaps the first copy of Whitman
seen in England, and when Cholmondeley began to read it to his
stepfather, Rev. Z. Macaulay, at Hodnet, that clergyman declared he
would not hear it, and threatened to throw it in the fire. On reading
the <i>Week</i> (he had received <i>Walden</i> from Thoreau when first in America),

 B. B. Wiley, then of Providence, since of Chicago (deceased), had
written to Thoreau, September 4, for the <i>Week</i>, which the author was
then selling on his own account, having bought back the unsalable
first edition from his publisher, Munroe. In a letter of October 31,
to which the above is a reply, he mentions taking a walk with Charles
Newcomb, then of Providence, since of London and Paris, now dead,&mdash;a
<i>Dial</i> contributor, and a special friend of Emerson; then inquires
about Confucius, the Hindoo philosophers, and Swedenborg.</p>

 When, in 1855 or 1856, Thoreau started to wade across from
Duxbury to Clark's Island, and was picked up by a fishing-boat in the
deep water, and landed on the "back side" of the island (see letter to
Mr. Watson of April 25, 1858), Edward Watson ("Uncle Ed") was
"saggin' round" to see that everything was right alongshore, and
encountered the unexpected visitor. "How did <i>you</i> come here?"
"Oh, from Duxbury," said Thoreau, and they walked to the old
Watson house together. "You say in one of your books," said
Uncle Ed, "that you once lost a horse and a hound and a dove,&mdash;now
I should like to know what you meant by that?" "Why, everybody
has met with losses, haven't they?" "H'm,&mdash;pretty way to
answer a fellow!" said Mr. Watson; but it seems this was the usual
answer. In the long dining-room of the old house that night he sat by
the window and told the story of the Norse voyagers to New England,&mdash;perhaps
to that very island and the Gurnet near by,&mdash;as Morton
fancies in his review of Thoreau in the <i>Harvard Magazine</i> (January,
1855).</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_77" id="Footnote_77" href="#FNanchor_77"><span class="label">[77]</span></a>
 This was when he spoke in the vestry of the Calvinistic church,
and said, on his return to Concord, "that he hoped he had done
something to upheave and demolish the structure above,"&mdash;the
vestry being beneath the church.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_78" id="Footnote_78" href="#FNanchor_78"><span class="label">[78]</span></a>
 Notwithstanding this unwillingness to lecture, Thoreau did speak
at Worcester, February 13, 1857, on "Walking," but scrupulously
added to his consent (February 6), "I told Brown it had not been
much altered since I read it in Worcester; but now I think of it, much
of it must have been new to you, because, having since divided it into
two, I am able to read what before I omitted. Nevertheless, I should
like to have it understood by those whom it concerns, that I am invited
to read in public (if it be so) what I have already read, in part, to a
private audience." This throws some light on his method of preparing
lectures, which were afterwards published as essays; they were made
up from his journals, and new entries expanded them.</p>

families were taught. At this date the lectures were given in the vestry
of the parish church, which Thoreau playfully termed "a meeting-house
cellar." It was there that Louisa Alcott acted plays.</p>

 Channing says (<i>Thoreau, the Poet-Naturalist</i>, new ed., pp. 41, 42):
"He made for himself a knapsack, with partitions for his books and
papers,&mdash;india-rubber cloth (strong and large and spaced, the common
knapsacks being unspaced).... After trying the merit of cocoa,
coffee, water, and the like, tea was put down as the felicity of a walking
'<i>travail</i>,'&mdash;tea plenty, strong, with enough sugar, made in a
tin pint cup.... He commended every party to carry 'a junk of heavy
cake' with plums in it, having found by long experience that after toil
it was a capital refreshment."</p>

 Marston Watson, whose uncle, Edward Watson, with his nephews,
owned the "breezy island" where Thoreau had visited his friends
(Clark's Island, the only one in Plymouth Bay), had built his own
house, "Hillside," on the slope of one of the hills above Plymouth town,
and there laid out a fine park and garden, which Thoreau surveyed
for him in the autumn of 1854, Alcott and Mr. Watson carrying the
chain. For a description of Hillside, see Channing's <i>Wanderer</i> (Boston,
1871) and Alcott's <i>Sonnets and Canzonets</i> (Boston: Roberts, 1882).
It was a villa much visited by Emerson, Alcott, Channing, Thoreau,
George Bradford, and the Transcendentalists generally. Mr. Watson
graduated at Harvard two years after Thoreau, and in an old diary
says, "I remember Thoreau in the college yard (1836) with downcast
thoughtful look intent, as if he were searching for something; always
in a green coat,&mdash;green because the authorities required black, I
suppose." In a letter he says: "I have always heard the 'Maiden in
the East' was Mrs. Watson,&mdash;Mary Russell Watson,&mdash;and I suppose
there is no doubt of it. I may be prejudiced, but I have always
thought it one of his best things,&mdash;and I have highly valued his lines.
I find in my <i>Dial</i>, No. 6, I have written six new stanzas in the margin
of Friendship, and they are numbered to show how they should run.
I think Mrs. Brown gave them to me."</p>

Channing himself was, no doubt, the "follower" and "companion"
here mentioned; no person so frequently walked with Thoreau in
his long excursions. They were together in New Boston, N. H.,
when the minister mentioned in the <i>Week</i> reproved Thoreau for not
going to meeting on Sunday. When I first lived in Concord (March,
1855), and asked the innkeeper what Sunday services the village held,
he replied, "There's the Orthodox, an' the Unitarian, an' th' Walden
Pond Association,"&mdash;meaning by the last what Emerson called "the
Walkers,"&mdash;those who rambled in the Walden woods on Sundays.</p>

 The club with which Thoreau here makes merry was the Saturday
Club, meeting at Parker's Hotel in Boston the last Saturday in each
month, of which Emerson, Agassiz, Longfellow, Holmes, Lowell,
Henry James, and other men of letters were members. Thoreau,
though invited, never seems to have met with them, as Channing did,
on one memorable occasion, at least, described by Mr. James in a
letter cited in the <i>Memoir of Bronson Alcott</i>, who also occasionally
dined with this club. The conversation at Emerson's next mentioned
was also memorable for the vigor with which Miss Mary Emerson,
then eighty-four years old, rebuked Mr. James for what she thought
his dangerous Antinomian views concerning the moral law.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_92" id="Footnote_92" href="#FNanchor_92"><span class="label">[92]</span></a>

 He was looking after the manufacture of fine plumbago for the
electrotypers, which was the family business after pencil-making grew
unprofitable. The Thoreaus had a grinding-mill in Acton, and a packing-shop
attached to their Concord house. "Parker's society," mentioned
at the close of the letter, was the congregation of Theodore
Parker, then in Italy, where he died in May, 1860.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_94" id="Footnote_94" href="#FNanchor_94"><span class="label">[94]</span></a>
 He was invited to a gathering of John Brown's friends at the
grave in the Adirondack woods. "Mr. Sanborn's case" was an indictment
and civil suit against Silas Carleton <i>et als.</i> for an attempt to kidnap
F. B. Sanborn, who had refused to accept the invitation of the
Senate at Washington to testify in the John Brown investigation.</p>

 This is the excursion described by Thoreau in a subsequent letter,&mdash;lasting
six days, and the first that Channing had made which
involved "camping out." It was also Thoreau's last visit to this favorite
mountain; but Channing continued to go there after the death of
his friend; and some of these visits are recorded in his poem "The
Wanderer." The last one was in September, 1869, when I accompanied
him, and we again spent five nights on the plateau where he had
camped with Thoreau. At that time, one of the "two good spruce
houses, half a mile apart," mentioned by Thoreau, was still standing,
in ruins,&mdash;the place called by Channing "Henry's Camp," and thus
described:&mdash;</p>

<p class="footnote footleft25">
<span class="i2">We built our fortress where you see</span><br />
Yon group of spruce-trees, sidewise on the line<br />
Where the horizon to the eastward bounds,&mdash;<br />
A point selected by sagacious art,<br />
Where all at once we viewed the Vermont hills,<br />
And the long outline of the mountain-ridge,<br />
Ever renewing, changeful every hour.<br />

 In April, 1859, Mr. Alcott was chosen superintendent of the public
schools of Concord, by a school committee of which Mr. Bull, the
creator of the Concord grape, and Mr. Sanborn, were members, and
for some years he directed the studies of the younger pupils, to their
great benefit and delight. At the yearly "exhibitions," songs were sung
composed by Louisa Alcott and others, and the whole town assembled
to see and hear. The stress of civil war gradually checked this idyllic
movement, and Mr. Alcott returned to his garden and library. It was
two years after this that Miss Alcott had her severe experience as
hospital nurse at Washington.</p>

 A word may be said of the after life of this magnanimous Englishman,
who did not long survive his Concord correspondent. In March,
1863, being then in command of a battalion of Shropshire Volunteers,
which he had raised, he inherited Condover Hall and the large estate
adjacent, and took the name of Owen as a condition of the inheritance.
A year later he married Miss Victoria Cotes, daughter of John
and Lady Louisa Cotes (Co. Salop), a godchild of the Queen, and
went to Italy for his wedding tour. In Florence he was seized with a
malignant fever, April 10, 1864, and died there April 20,&mdash;not quite
two years after Thoreau's death. His brother Reginald, who had
met him in Florence, carried back his remains to England, and he is
buried in Condover churchyard. Writing to an American friend, Mr.
R. Cholmondeley said: "The whole county mourned for one who
had made himself greatly beloved. During his illness his thoughts
went back very much to America and her great sufferings. His large
heart felt for your country as if it were his own." It seems that he did
not go to New Zealand with the "Canterbury Pilgrims," as suggested
in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> (December, 1893), but in the first of Lord
Lyttelton's ships (the Charlotte Jane), having joined in Lord L.'s
scheme for colonizing the island, where he remained only six months,
near Christchurch.</p>

 This was a short-lived monthly, edited at Cincinnati (1861-62)
by Moncure D. Conway, since distinguished as an author, who had
resided for a time in Concord, after leaving his native Virginia. He
wrote asking Thoreau and all his Concord friends to contribute to
this new <i>Dial</i>, and several of them did so.</p>

 Channing more than once described to me Thoreau's disheveled
appearance as he came down the mountain the next morning, after
rather a comfortless night. He was carrying for valise a green leather
satchel that had been Charles Emerson's, having but recently been
the guest of both William and Waldo Emerson. In depicting the scene
from the Berkshire mountain, he recurred (in the <i>Week</i>) to the homesteads
of the Huguenots on Staten Island, where he had rambled the
year before this Berkshire experience, while living at William Emerson's
and giving lessons to his sons.</p>
